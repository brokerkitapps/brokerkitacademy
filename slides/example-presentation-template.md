## Tips for Creating Effective Slide Content

1. **Use clear headings**: Each `##` becomes a new slide or section
2. **Keep it concise**: Bullet points work better than long paragraphs
3. **Add context**: Explain why each point matters
4. **Include examples**: Real-world cases help understanding
5. **Think visually**: Mention where images/charts would help
6. **Structure logically**: Flow from intro → content → conclusion
7. **Make it actionable**: Give specific steps to implement
