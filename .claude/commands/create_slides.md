$ARGUMENTS

**Your Task:**

1. **Understand the Request**
   - If the user provided a topic/idea, you'll need to generate the content
   - If the user referenced an existing file (e.g., `slides/filename.md`), read that file
   - If unclear, ask the user for clarification

2. **Generate Content (if needed)**
   - Review `CLAUDE.md` for context about:
     - Brokerkit platform capabilities
     - Relitix MLS data integration
     - Brokerboost lead generation services
     - Real estate recruiting best practices
     - Target audience (residential real estate brokerages and team leaders)

   - Create comprehensive markdown content appropriate for the presentation type:
     - **For presentations**: Clear sections with bullet points, key concepts, examples
     - **For webinars**: Include poll questions, demo moments, engagement prompts
     - **For bootcamp training**: Progressive learning, hands-on exercises, practice tasks

   - Structure the content with:
     - Clear headings using `#` and `##` markdown syntax
     - Bullet points for key information
     - Examples and use cases
     - Call-outs for important points
     - Suggested visual elements (e.g., "screenshot of dashboard here")

3. **Save Content Locally**
   - Save the markdown content to `slides/` directory
   - Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `slides/agent-recruiting-strategies-q1.md`)
   - Ensure the content is well-formatted and ready for Gamma to process

4. **Determine Presentation Parameters**
   - **Title**: Extract or create a clear title
   - **Number of Cards**: Based on content length
     - Short presentation (10-15 slides)
     - Standard presentation (15-25 slides)
     - Long presentation/training (25-40 slides)
   - **Theme**: Suggest using "Berlin" or "Cape" for professional content (optional)
   - **Format**: Usually "presentation" (but could be "document" or "social")

5. **Create Gamma Presentation**
   - Run the Python script using:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/gamma/create_slides.py --file slides/[filename].md --title "[Title]" --num-cards [number] --verbose
   ```
   - Optional: Add `--theme [theme-name]` if you want a specific theme
   - The script will:
     - Create the presentation in Gamma using AI
     - Track metadata in `slides/gamma_metadata.json`
     - Return the Gamma URL

6. **Present Results to User**
   - Show the Gamma URL prominently
   - Confirm the local file location
   - Mention the number of slides created
   - Suggest that the user can now view and edit the presentation in Gamma
   - Gamma will automatically:
     - Format the content professionally
     - Add relevant stock images
     - Apply the chosen theme
     - Create visual layouts

**Important Notes:**
- The Gamma API uses AI to enhance your content with:
  - Professional layouts and design
  - Relevant stock images from AI generation
  - Smart formatting and visual hierarchy
  - Theme-based color schemes
- After creation, the user can edit the presentation in Gamma's web interface
- The local markdown file serves as version control for the content
- All presentations are tracked in `slides/gamma_metadata.json`

**Example Workflow:**

```
