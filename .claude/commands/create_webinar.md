$ARGUMENTS

If you want, you can:
- Explore existing webinar content in the `assets/slides/` directory to understand the style and format we use for Brokerkit Academy webinars

- Review `claude.md` for comprehensive information about:
  - Brokerkit platform capabilities and features
  - Relitix MLS data integration
  - Brokerboost lead generation services
  - Real estate agent recruiting best practices
  - Target audience (residential real estate brokerages and team leaders in US/Canada)

- Check the `scripts/` directory for existing Python automation that could help generate Gamma slides

**Webinar-Specific Considerations:**

- **Format**: 30-60 minute live presentation via Google Meet
- **Delivery**: Using Gamma slide deck with screen sharing
- **Goal**: Focused deep-dive on a specific topic or strategy

**Content Structure:**
1. **Opening (5 min)**: Hook, intro, agenda, what attendees will learn
2. **Main Content (20-40 min)**: Core teaching with 2-4 key sections
3. **Demo/Walkthrough (5-10 min)**: Live platform demonstration
4. **Q&A (5-10 min)**: Address attendee questions
5. **Closing (5 min)**: Recap, call-to-action, next steps

**Engagement Strategies:**
- Include poll questions at strategic moments
- Plan interactive moments (chat questions, live demos)
- Suggest "pause and practice" moments for platform exercises
- Add "Ask in chat" prompts throughout

**Slide Recommendations:**
- Recommend 15-25 slides for optimal pacing
- Suggest key sections and slide titles
- Mark slides that need screenshots with "what to show here" tags
- Identify demo moments and platform walkthroughs
- Include engagement slides (polls, questions, exercises)

**Suggest 3 potential webinar angles:**
1. **Feature spotlight**: Deep-dive on specific Brokerkit tool or workflow
2. **Strategy session**: Recruiting/retention tactics with Brokerkit examples
3. **Data-driven insights**: Using Relitix analytics to improve outcomes

**Visual Content:**
- Platform screenshots showing exact workflows
- Before/after examples of recruiting campaigns
- Data visualizations from Relitix
- Real success stories from brokerages

Remember: Webinars should be focused, actionable, and leave attendees ready to implement what they learned immediately in their Brokerkit account!
