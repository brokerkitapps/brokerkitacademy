$ARGUMENTS

If you want, you can:
- Explore the existing content in the `docs/` and `slides/` directories to understand the style and format we use for Brokerkit Academy materials

- Review `claude.md` for comprehensive information about:
  - Brokerkit platform capabilities and features
  - Relitix MLS data integration
  - Brokerboost lead generation services
  - Real estate agent recruiting best practices
  - Target audience (residential real estate brokerages and team leaders in US/Canada)

- Check the `scripts/` directory for existing Python automation that could help generate or format content

- Consider the training context:
  - Is this for Customer Bootcamp, a webinar, or standalone material?
  - Should this be a handout (markdown â†’ Google Docs) or slide deck (Gamma)?
  - What specific Brokerkit features or workflows should be highlighted?
  - What recruiting/retention challenges does this address?

- Suggest 3 potential approaches for the content, each with different angles:
  1. Platform feature-focused (how to use Brokerkit tools)
  2. Strategy-focused (recruiting/retention best practices)
  3. Data-driven (leveraging Relitix insights and metrics)

For presentation slides:
- Recommend key sections and slide titles
- Suggest "what to show here" tags for screenshots or visuals
- Consider flow for live training delivery

For handouts and scripts:
- Structure as actionable, step-by-step guides
- Include specific Brokerkit platform references
- Provide real-world examples from residential real estate
- Add call-to-action items for attendees

Remember: Our goal is empowering brokers and team leaders to build thriving agent teams using Brokerkit's platform, data, and best practices!
