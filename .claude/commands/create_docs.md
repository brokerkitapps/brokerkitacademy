$ARGUMENTS

If you want, you can:
- Explore existing handouts in the `assets/content/` directory to understand the style and format we use for Brokerkit Academy materials

- Review `claude.md` for comprehensive information about:
  - Brokerkit platform capabilities and features
  - Relitix MLS data integration
  - Brokerboost lead generation services
  - Real estate agent recruiting best practices
  - Target audience (residential real estate brokerages and team leaders in US/Canada)

- Check the `scripts/` directory for existing Python automation that could help format or convert content

**Documentation-Specific Considerations:**

- **Format**: Markdown files that will be imported into Google Docs
- **Purpose**: Practical, printable resources for immediate use
- **Goal**: Actionable reference materials and scripts

**Content Types:**

1. **Call Scripts**:
   - Conversation frameworks for recruiter-agent calls
   - Include opening, qualifying questions, objection handling, closing
   - Provide word-for-word examples and fill-in-the-blank templates
   - Add notes for personalization

2. **Quick Reference Guides**:
   - Step-by-step checklists for Brokerkit workflows
   - One-page overviews of key features
   - Visual process flows
   - Tips and best practices sidebars

3. **Handouts**:
   - Training session takeaways
   - Key metrics to track
   - Recruiting campaign templates
   - Onboarding checklists

4. **Best Practice Documents**:
   - Strategic frameworks for recruiting
   - Data analysis guides using Relitix
   - Campaign optimization strategies

**Structure for Actionability:**
- Start with clear objective: "Use this to..."
- Include step-by-step instructions with numbered lists
- Add specific Brokerkit platform references (menu paths, button names)
- Provide real-world examples from residential real estate
- Include checkboxes for task completion
- End with call-to-action: "Next steps..."

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Use clear headings and subheadings (H2, H3)
- Include bullet points and numbered lists for scanability
- Add callout boxes for important tips (use blockquotes)
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Use bold for key terms and platform features
- Include placeholders like [AGENT NAME] or [BROKERAGE NAME]

**Suggest 3 potential documentation approaches:**
1. **Template-focused**: Fill-in-the-blank scripts and frameworks
2. **Process-focused**: Step-by-step workflow guides with screenshots
3. **Example-focused**: Real scenarios with actual dialogue and outcomes

**Include These Elements:**
- Clear title and purpose statement
- Quick-start summary box
- Main content with examples
- Tips and common pitfalls
- Resources and next steps
- Link to relevant Brokerkit platform features

Remember: Great documentation should be so clear that someone can pick it up and use it immediately without additional training!
