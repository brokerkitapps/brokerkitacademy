## Part 3: Managing LinkedIn Follow-Up

### When Agents Respond, You Take Over

---

## Your LinkedIn Follow-Up Cadence

**When an agent accepts your connection and replies to Laura's message:**

**Your goal:**
- Build rapport
- Understand their needs
- Guide conversation toward a meeting

**Remember:** Relationship-building, not hard sell

---

## Step 1: The Initial Response - Build Rapport

**When an agent replies:**

1. **Acknowledge and Engage:** Thank them for connecting. Keep it light.
2. **Ask an Easy, Open-Ended Question:** Don't jump to business.

**Examples:**

"Thanks for connecting, [Agent's Name]! Great to meet another pro in the Florida market. How has your year been so far?"

"Hi [Agent's Name], appreciate the connection. I see you do a lot of business in [Their City]. How's the market treating you over there?"

**Brokerkit Pro-Tip:** Create a follow-up task for 2-3 days if no response

---

## Step 2: Uncover Needs & Pain Points

**Use discovery questions to understand their situation:**

**Ask one question at a time:**

- "What do you enjoy most about where you're at currently?"
- "What's been the biggest challenge for you in the business lately?"
- "If you could change one thing about your current brokerage support, what would it be?"
- "What are you focused on for growth in the next 12 months?"

---

## Common Agent Pain Points

**Listen for these challenges:**

- Needing more or better quality leads
- Lack of training, mentorship, or support
- Frustration with company culture
- Outdated technology
- Unfavorable commission splits or fees

**These pain points = your opportunity**

---

## Step 3: The Pivot - Connect Pain to Solution

**When they share a challenge:**

1. **Acknowledge and Empathize:**
   "I hear that a lot. It can be really frustrating when you don't have the right tech to support your business."

2. **Introduce Your Solution:**
   "That's actually why we invested in [Your CRM/Tech]. We wanted to give our agents a seamless system to save them time."

3. **Gauge Interest:**
   "Would you be open to hearing about how we handle that?"

---

## Step 4: The Ask - Secure the Meeting

**If they express interest, move offline:**

**Frame as no-pressure chat:**

"I'd be happy to share more. I'm not trying to sell you anything, but I'm passionate about what we're building. Would you be open to a brief, informal chat next week to see if there might be a fit?"

**Make it easy to schedule:**

"Here's a link to my calendar: [Link]. Let me know once you find a spot."

---

## What If the Conversation Stalls?

**Agents are busy. Don't give up:**

**Follow-Up 1 (3-4 days later):**
"Hey [Agent's Name], I know how busy things can get. Just wanted to follow up on our chat. Let me know if you're still open to connecting."

**Follow-Up 2 (1 week later):**
"Hey again, [Agent's Name]. I know things are crazy. Want me to leave you alone? No problem at all if so!"

**This direct, respectful approach often gets a response**

---

## Part 4: Handling Call Tasks in Brokerkit

### Your Hottest Leads

---

## What Are Call Tasks?

**Action items generated when agents engage:**

- Accept LinkedIn connection request
- Reply to LinkedIn message
- Open or click links in emails
- Show engagement signals indicating interest

**Each task includes:**
- Agent's name and contact info
- Production history and transaction data
- Notes about engagement
- LinkedIn profile and recent activity
- Agent alerts (closings, listings) with Relitix

---

## Prioritizing Your Call Tasks

**Not all tasks are equal. Prioritize by:**

1. **Recency:** Most recent responders first (same day if possible)
2. **Engagement Level:**
   - Replied to messages > Accepted connections > Opened emails
3. **Production Level:** Your ideal agent avatar
4. **Recent Activity:** Agents with recent closings/listings (agent alerts)

**Focus on quality conversations, not just quantity**

---

## Best Times to Call Real Estate Agents

**Avoid these times:**
- Early mornings (before 9 AM) - preparing for showings
- Mid-day weekends (10 AM - 4 PM) - showings and open houses
- Late evenings (after 8 PM) - personal time

**Best times:**
- Weekday mornings: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Weekday late afternoons: 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Early weekday evenings: 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM
- Sunday evenings: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM

---

## Preparing Before Your Call

**Spend 2-3 minutes reviewing in Brokerkit:**

✅ Agent's production history (last 12 months)
✅ Recent agent alerts (closings, listings, price changes)
✅ Their LinkedIn profile (posts, career highlights)
✅ What message they responded to
✅ Their brokerage affiliation and market area

**Set yourself up:**
- Have Brokerkit profile open
- Notepad ready for logging
- Quiet environment
- Calendar link ready

---

## Part 5: Agent Recruiting Call Scripts

### Script 1: Initial Outreach Call

---

## Initial Call: Introduction

**Use when calling agents who engaged but haven't talked to you yet:**

"Hi [Agent's Name], this is [Your Name] with [Your Brokerage]. How are you doing today?"

[Wait for response]

"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you [accepted my LinkedIn connection / opened my email / replied to my message]. I know you're probably busy, so I'll be quick—do you have just two minutes?"

---

## Initial Call: Build Rapport

**Reference recent activity:**

"First, I wanted to say congratulations on [recent closing/new listing]. That's a great property in [neighborhood]. How did that come about?"

[Listen and engage authentically]

**This shows you've done your homework and care about their success**

---

## Initial Call: Discovery

"I'm always curious about what's working well for successful agents like you. Can I ask—what do you like most about your current brokerage situation?"

[Listen carefully—this tells you what they value]

"That's great. And on the flip side, if there was one thing you could change or improve about your current setup, what would it be?"

[Listen for pain points: leads, tech, splits, support, culture, training]

---

## Initial Call: The Pivot

"I appreciate you sharing that. You know, [acknowledge their pain point]—that's actually one of the biggest reasons I reached out. We've been focusing a lot on [your solution] at [Your Brokerage], and it's made a huge difference for our agents."

"I'm not calling to pitch you or sell you anything today, but I'd love to learn more about what you're working on and share a bit about what we're doing here. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute conversation sometime this week or next?"

---

## Initial Call: Closing

**If YES:**
"Awesome! Let me send you a link to my calendar—it'll show my availability and you can grab a time that works for you. Does that work?"
[Send calendar link immediately]

**If NOT NOW:**
"No problem at all! I totally get it—timing isn't always right. Can I stay in touch and circle back in a few months?"
[Log follow-up task for 60-90 days]

**If NOT INTERESTED:**
"I completely understand. If anything changes or you know any agents who might be a fit, I'd love an introduction. Best of luck!"

---

## Script 2: Follow-Up Call (LinkedIn Responders)

**Use when agent already engaged on LinkedIn:**

"Hi [Agent's Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Brokerage]. We've been chatting a bit on LinkedIn—do you have a quick minute to talk?"

[Wait for response]

---

## Follow-Up Call: Reference the Conversation

"Thanks! So in our LinkedIn chat, you mentioned [reference something specific they said]. I wanted to dive a bit deeper into that if you're open to it."

**Ask follow-up discovery questions:**

"When you say [their pain point], what does that look like day-to-day for you? Can you give me an example?"

"And how long has this been an issue? Is it something you've brought up with your current broker?"

[This reveals if they're actively looking or just exploring]

---

## Follow-Up Call: Introduce Value Proposition

"I really appreciate you sharing that. Look, what we're doing at [Your Brokerage] is [explain how you solve their problem]. For example, [share brief success story or stat]."

"I think there could be a great fit here, but I'd rather show you than tell you. Can we set up a time to meet—either over coffee or a quick Zoom—so I can walk you through what we offer and you can decide if it makes sense for you?"

---

## Follow-Up Call: Closing

"I promise it'll be low-pressure and informative. Even if it's not the right fit right now, I think you'll get some value out of the conversation. How does [suggest two specific time slots] work for you?"

**If YES:** Confirm meeting and send calendar invite immediately

**If NOT NOW:** Same follow-up approach as initial call

---

## Script 3: Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

---

## Objection: "I'm happy where I'm at."

**Your response:**

"That's great to hear! I'm not calling to pull you away from something that's working. I'm just curious—is there anything about your current setup that, if you could improve it, would make your business even better?"

[Listen for even small pain points, then explore further]

**Even happy agents have something they'd change**

---

## Objection: "I'm too busy to talk right now."

**Your response:**

"I completely understand—I know how crazy the market can be. Would it be better if I called you back at a different time? Or I can send you my calendar link and you can grab a time that works best for you?"

**Give them control over timing**

---

## Objection: "I'm under contract / signed a non-compete."

**Your response:**

"Got it. No worries at all. When does that wrap up?"

[Note the date and set follow-up task in Brokerkit]

"Cool. Let's stay in touch. I'll reach back out around that time, and if you're open to it, we can connect then. Sound good?"

**Respect their situation and plan for the future**

---

## Objection: "What's your commission split?"

**Your response:**

"Great question. Our splits are competitive and depend on your production level and support needs. But honestly, I've found that the best agents care less about splits and more about net income at the end of the year. Can I ask—what are you netting right now after all your fees and expenses?"

[Shift conversation from splits to total value]

"Our model is built around [leads, support, tech], which is why our agents often net more even if the split looks similar. That's something I'd love to walk you through. Does that sound interesting?"

---

## Objection: "I need to think about it."

**Your response:**

"Totally fair. I'm not asking you to make a decision today—I'm just asking if you'd be open to a no-obligation conversation to learn more. What specifically do you need to think about? Maybe I can help clarify."

[Address their concern directly]

**Uncover the real objection**

---

## Script 4: Booking the Meeting

**Once an agent expresses interest:**

"Awesome! I'm glad you're open to it. Here's what I'd like to do: let's set up a quick 15-20 minute call where I can learn more about your business and share what we're building here. No pressure—just a conversation to see if there's a mutual fit. Sound good?"

"I'll shoot you my calendar link right now via [text/email]. Grab any time that works for you, and I'll send you a confirmation. If anything changes, just let me know. Deal?"

---

## After the Call: Critical Actions

**Don't skip these steps:**

1. **Send calendar link immediately** (text or email)
2. **Log detailed notes in Brokerkit:**
   - What you discussed
   - Their pain points
   - Interest level
   - Next steps
3. **Set follow-up reminder** if they don't book within 24 hours
4. **Send personalized LinkedIn message** thanking them for the call

**Documentation = organization = success**

---

## Part 6: Multi-Channel Follow-Up Strategy

### Coordinate All Three Channels

---

## When to Use Each Channel

**LinkedIn Message:**
- Warm, conversational engagement
- Sharing resources
- Staying top-of-mind
- **Timing:** Immediate responses; ongoing nurturing

**Phone Call:**
- Building rapport quickly
- Handling objections
- Closing for meetings
- **Timing:** Same day when they engage

**Email:**
- Sending calendar links
- Sharing documents
- Formal follow-ups
- **Timing:** After phone calls; scheduled reminders

---

## The Multi-Touch Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1:**
- Agent engages with outreach
- Call them same day (Script 1 or 2)
- If no answer: voicemail + LinkedIn message

**Day 3:**
- If no response, send follow-up LinkedIn message
- Reference something from their profile

**Day 7:**
- Second call attempt (different time of day)
- Short email with calendar link

**Day 14:**
- Final LinkedIn message: "Want me to stop bugging you?"
- This often gets a response!

**Day 30+:**
- Log as "not now"
- Set 90-day follow-up task
- Continue engaging with their posts

---

## Tracking Multi-Channel Conversations

**Stay organized in Brokerkit:**

**After Every Call:**
- Log notes in agent's profile
- What you discussed
- Their pain points
- Next steps

**After Every LinkedIn Exchange:**
- Add note summarizing conversation

**Set Tasks for Follow-Ups:**
- Never rely on memory
- "Call in 3 months" = 90-day task
- Meeting booked = 24-hour reminder to confirm

**Tag Agents by Status:**
- Hot Lead (ready to meet)
- Warm Lead (interested, timing not right)
- Nurture (follow up in 90 days)
- Not Interested (respect decision)
