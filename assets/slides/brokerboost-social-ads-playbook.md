---

## Finding Your Social Ad Leads

### Three Access Methods

---

## Method 1: Today Section (Easiest)

1. Log into Brokerkit
2. Click "Today" in left navigation
3. View "New Leads" section
4. All social ad leads appear with source "social ads"

**Best for:** Daily lead review

---

## Method 2: Recruiting Agenda Email

**Get a daily digest:**

1. Go to User Settings → Notifications
2. Check "Recruiting Agenda"
3. Click "Update Notifications"
4. Receive morning email with new leads and tasks

**Best for:** Morning planning routine

---

## Method 3: Advanced Filters (Most Powerful)

1. Click "Show advanced options"
2. Filter by Source field
3. Select "social ads"
4. Combine with other filters
5. Save frequently-used combinations

**Best for:** Detailed searching and segmentation

---

## Platform Attribution Matters

**Check "Referrer Notes" in each lead profile:**

- Facebook or Instagram source
- Which campaign they responded to
- Date and time of inquiry

**Why it matters:**
- Instagram leads: Younger (25-40)
- Facebook leads: More established (35-55)
- Helps tailor your conversation

---

## Lead Prioritization Strategy

### Not All Inquiries Are Equal

---

## Prioritize By These Factors

### 1. Recency
Contact within 24-48 hours (same-day ideal)
- Social media users expect fast responses
- They're likely exploring multiple options

### 2. Engagement Signals
- Opened emails = higher interest
- Clicked calendar link = very high interest
- Responded to texts = ready for conversation

### 3. Timing of Inquiry
- Weekday = may be frustrated at work
- Weekend = researching options
- Evening = career reflection time

---

## Best Times to Contact

**Best Times:**
- Weekday late mornings: 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM
- Weekday mid-afternoons: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- Weekday early evenings: 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM
- Sunday evenings: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM

**Avoid:**
- Early mornings before 10 AM
- Lunchtime (12-1 PM)
- After 8 PM weekdays
- Weekend mid-day (open houses)

---

## Pre-Call Preparation (2 Minutes)

**Review before calling:**

✅ Their inquiry date
✅ Referrer Notes (Facebook/Instagram?)
✅ Which ad they responded to
✅ Email opens and link clicks
✅ Retargeting vs. cold audience

**Set yourself up:**
- Have Brokerkit profile open
- Quiet professional environment
- Calendar link ready
- Review company differentiators
- Prepare for "I don't remember" response

---

## Initial Contact Script

### First Contact Call

---

## Opening (Script 1)

**Introduction:**

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with [Your Brokerage]. How are you doing?"

[Wait for response]

"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you inquired about opportunities with our team through [Facebook/Instagram]. I know you're probably in the middle of your day, so I'll keep this quick—do you have just two or three minutes?"

---

## If They Say Yes

"Awesome, I appreciate it! So just to give you some quick context: You filled out a short form on one of our ads—we're currently growing our team and looking for sharp agents who want [your key value prop]."

"Can I ask—what caught your attention about our ad? What made you want to learn more?"

**Listen carefully—this reveals their pain point or desire**

---

## Discovery Questions

Choose 2-3 based on their answer:

- "How long have you been in real estate?"
- "What do you love most about where you're at currently?"
- "What's been the biggest challenge in growing your business?"
- "If you could change one thing about your current brokerage, what would it be?"
- "Are you actively looking to make a move, or more exploring?"

**Listen for:** Frustration, lack of leads, poor support, commission concerns

---

## The Pivot: Connect Pain to Solution

"That's really helpful to know. You know, [acknowledge their pain point]—I hear that a lot from agents. That's actually one of the main reasons we've been growing. We focus on [your solution]."

"For example, [share brief success story]."

"Based on what you're sharing, I think there could be a really good fit here. But rather than tell you everything on this call, what I'd love to do is schedule a time where we can have a real conversation—no pressure, just exploring. Would you be open to that?"

---

## Closing the Call

**If YES:**
"Perfect! I'll send you a link to my calendar. What's better—text or email?"

**If "LET ME THINK ABOUT IT":**
"Totally understand. Can I ask what you want to think about specifically?"
[Address concern, then send calendar link anyway]

**If "NOT INTERESTED":**
"I completely understand. Just out of curiosity—is it bad timing, or just not a fit?"
[If timing: set 90-day follow-up]

---

## Handling "I Don't Remember That Ad"

### THE Most Common Response

---

## The Smooth Response (Casual & Light)

"Oh yeah, I totally get that! You probably see a million things in your Facebook feed every day. Ours was the one about [reference ad hook]. You clicked through and filled out a quick form—took like 30 seconds."

[Pause briefly, stay upbeat]

"But hey, now that I have you—is this still something you're curious about? Or did I catch you at a time when you're focused on other things?"

---

## Alternative Approach (More Direct)

"No worries at all—those forms are so quick and easy to forget! But here's the thing: Whether you remember the specific ad or not, you clearly had a reason for wanting to learn more about other opportunities."

"So let me ask you this: Are you genuinely happy where you're at, or are there things you'd improve if you could?"

**This shifts focus from the ad to their current situation**

---

## Key Principles for This Objection

**Always remember:**

- NEVER make them feel bad or defensive
- Acknowledge it's easy to forget online forms
- Shift focus from "the ad" to "their situation"
- Give them an easy, no-pressure path forward
- Be willing to let them go if truly not interested

**This objection is normal—handle it smoothly!**

---

## Voicemail & Text Scripts

### Multi-Channel Approach

---

## Voicemail Script

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Brokerage]. I saw you inquired about opportunities with our team through [Facebook/Instagram], and I wanted to personally reach out. I know you're busy, so I'm also going to shoot you a quick text with some info. If you're open to a conversation about what we offer, I'd love to connect. My number is [your number], or just text me back. Thanks!"

**Follow up immediately:**
- Text within 2 minutes
- Email within 5 minutes

---

## Text Message Templates

**Text #1 (Right After Voicemail):**

"Hi [First Name]! [Your Name] from [Brokerage] here. Just tried calling about your inquiry with us. Here's a quick link to schedule a call when you're free: [calendar link]. No pressure—just want to answer any questions!"

---

## Follow-Up Texts

**Text #2 (After 3 Days):**

"Hey [First Name], just wanted to follow up! Still curious about what we offer, or did I catch you at a busy time? If you're interested, grab a time here: [calendar link]. If not, totally understand—just let me know!"

**Text #3 (After 7 Days - Permission to Stop):**

"Hi [First Name], I know how busy life gets! This is my last check-in about opportunities with [Brokerage]. If you're interested, here's my calendar: [calendar link]. If not, no worries—I'll stop bugging you! 😊"

**This "permission to stop" message often gets responses!**

---

## Common Objections

### How to Handle Each One

---

## "I Was Just Curious—Not Really Looking"

**Your Response:**

"I totally get that, and honestly, most of our best agents weren't actively looking when they first reached out. They were just curious, like you."

"But here's what I've found: Even if you're happy where you are, it's smart to know what else is out there. That way, if your situation ever changes, you're not starting from scratch."

"Can I ask—what would it take for you to actually consider making a move?"

---

## "I'm Happy Where I'm At"

**Your Response:**

"That's awesome! I'm genuinely glad to hear that. Out of curiosity, what makes it such a good fit for you?"

[Listen—this tells you what they value]

"That's great that they provide [whatever they mentioned]. Can I ask just one more question: If there was one thing you could improve or add, what would it be?"

[Even "happy" agents usually have something they'd change]

"Interesting. [Acknowledge their point] is actually something we really focus on. Would you be open to a quick conversation just to see what we offer? Think of it as market intelligence."

---

## "I'm Under Contract"

**Your Response:**

"Totally understand—contracts matter. Can I ask when your contract is up?"

[Note the date]

"Got it. I don't want to create any issues for you, so I'll respect that timeline. How about this: Can I reach back out around [month before contract ends] to reconnect?"

**Set a follow-up task in Brokerkit for 30 days before their contract ends**

---

## "What's Your Commission Split?"

**Your Response:**

"I appreciate you getting right to it! Our splits are competitive and depend on what level of support you want. But here's what I've learned: The agents who focus only on splits often leave money on the table."

"Can I ask—what are you currently netting after all your fees, desk costs, and expenses?"

"And how many deals are you doing per year?"

"Here's why I asked: Our model is [explain value prop], which means agents often net more per deal AND close more deals. I'd love to walk you through the full financial picture. Would you be open to that?"

---

## Multi-Touch Follow-Up Strategy

### Persistence Wins

---

## The Complete 14-Day Sequence

**Day 1:** Call #1 + Voicemail + Text #1 + Email #1
**Day 2:** Call #2 (different time)
**Day 3:** Text #2 + Call #3 if they responded
**Day 5:** Email #2 + Call #4 if email opened
**Day 7:** Text #3 ("permission to stop")
**Day 10:** Email #3 (value-add resource)
**Day 14:** Final call + final voicemail

**Day 30+:** Update to "Nurture - Long Term" and set 90-day follow-up
