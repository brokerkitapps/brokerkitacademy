1. **Recency** - Contact new leads within 24 hours (same-day ideal)
2. **Score** - Higher scores first (8-10 before 6-7)
3. **Experience Level** - Match to your hiring goals
4. **Resume Quality** - Professional resumes = serious candidates
5. **Engagement Signals** - Opened your automated emails? Higher intent

## Best Times to Contact Job Seekers

**Best Times:**
- Weekday mornings: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Weekday late afternoons: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- Weekday evenings: 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM

**Avoid:**
- Early mornings before 9 AM
- Lunch hours (12-1 PM)
- Late evenings after 8 PM
- Weekends (they compartmentalize job hunting to weekdays)

Job seekers have different availability than employed agents!

## Pre-Call Preparation (2-3 Minutes)

**Before calling any candidate, review:**

✅ Their resume (Resume tab in Brokerkit)
✅ AI score and qualification reasoning
✅ Suggested follow-up approaches
✅ Application date (how long waiting?)
✅ Automated emails they've opened/clicked

**Set yourself up:**
- Have their profile open on your screen
- Keep notepad ready for call notes
- Have your calendar link ready
- Quiet environment
- Smile before you dial (they can hear it!)

## First Contact Call Script

**Introduction:**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Brokerage]. How are you doing today?"

*[Wait for response]*

"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you inquired about the real estate agent opportunity with us. I know you're probably busy, so I'll be quick—do you have just a couple of minutes?"

---

## Discovery Phase

**If They Say Yes:**

"Awesome! First, thanks for your interest. I had a chance to review your resume and I'm impressed with [specific thing from resume]."

"Can I ask—what sparked your interest in exploring real estate as a career?"

*[Listen carefully—this reveals their motivation]*

---

## Key Discovery Questions

**Choose 2-3 of these:**

- "What attracted you to our company specifically?"
- "Are you currently working in another field, or already licensed?"
- "What's your timeline? Starting right away or planning for a few months?"
- "Have you talked with other brokerages, or are we your first conversation?"
- "What's most important to you in choosing where to launch your career?"

**Listen for:** Training needs, income goals, flexibility desires, support expectations

---

## The Transition to Next Steps

"That's really helpful context. Based on what you're sharing, I think there could be a great fit here. We specialize in [your unique value prop], which sounds like exactly what you're looking for."

"Here's what I'd love to do: Let's schedule a brief 20-minute call where I can walk you through our training program, commission structure, and support system, and you can ask me any questions. No pressure at all—just a conversation to see if we're a mutual fit. Does that sound good?"

---

## Closing the Call

**If YES:**
"Perfect! Let me send you a link to my calendar so you can grab a time that works. What's the best way—text or email?"

*Send link immediately*

"Great, I just sent it over. Go ahead and book a time, and I'll send confirmation. Looking forward to talking more!"

---

## Handling "I Don't Remember Applying"

**This is VERY common. Handle it smoothly:**

"Oh no worries at all! You filled out a quick form on [Indeed/ZipRecruiter] expressing interest in real estate opportunities with us. It was probably just a 30-second thing—easy to forget with everything going on!"

*[Pause briefly, stay light and friendly]*

"But hey, since I have you on the phone, I'd love to ask: Is real estate still something you're exploring, or did I catch you at a time when you're focused on other opportunities?"

**Key:** Never make them feel bad. Focus on where they are NOW, not the forgotten application.

---

## Voicemail Script

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. I saw you inquired about our real estate agent opportunity and wanted to reach out personally to answer any questions. I know you're probably busy, so I'll also send you a quick text and email with some info. If you're still exploring real estate as a career, I'd love to connect. Call me back at [number] or just text me. Thanks and talk soon!"

**Follow up immediately:**
- Text within 2 minutes
- Email within 5 minutes
- Both include calendar link

---

## Text Message Templates

**Text #1 (Right After Voicemail):**

"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. I just called about your inquiry with us. Here's a quick link to schedule a call when you're free: [calendar link]. No pressure—just want to answer any questions! 🙂"

**Text #2 (Follow-Up After 3 Days):**

"Hi [First Name]! Just wanted to follow up on the real estate opportunity. Still interested in learning more? If so, grab a time here: [calendar link]. If not, no worries—just let me know!"

---

## Objection: "I'm Just Looking Around"

"I totally get that—smart to explore your options! Most of our best agents talked to 3-4 brokerages before deciding where to land. Can I ask what's most important to you as you evaluate different companies?"

*[Listen to their criteria]*

"That makes sense. Well, even if you're just in the exploring phase, I'd love to share what we offer so you have all the information when you do make your decision. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call so you can add us to your list of options to consider?"

---

## Objection: "What's Your Commission Split?"

"Great question—I appreciate you being direct! Our splits are competitive and depend on your experience level and the support you need. But honestly, I've found that the best agents care less about splits and more about total income potential."

"Can I ask—what are you hoping to earn in your first year? And are you more interested in having leads provided, or building your own book of business?"

*[Shift from splits to their goals]*

"Perfect. Based on that, here's how our model works... I'd love to walk you through the full compensation structure on a quick call. Does [day/time] work?"

---

## Objection: "I Don't Have Any Real Estate Experience"

"That's actually not a problem at all—some of our top producers came from completely different industries. What matters more is your willingness to learn, your work ethic, and your people skills."

"Can I ask what you're doing now?"

*[Listen to background]*

"You know what—your experience in [their field] is actually really valuable in real estate because [connect the dots]. Plus, we have a comprehensive training program designed specifically for people new to the industry. We don't expect you to know real estate—we'll teach you that. What we're looking for is the right attitude and commitment."

---

## The Interview/Discovery Call

**20-30 minute conversation to dive deeper:**

**Agenda:**
1. **Their Story** (10 min) - Why real estate? Goals? Experience? Concerns?
2. **Your Offering** (15 min) - Training, compensation, leads, tools, culture
3. **Next Steps** (5 min) - Onboarding process, timeline, what they need to do

**Positioning:**
"Let's schedule a brief call where I can walk you through our program and you can ask anything. Think of it as a two-way interview—you're interviewing us just as much as we're interviewing you. No pressure at all. Sound good?"

---

## Closing the Interview

**If They're Clearly a Fit:**

"Well [Name], based on our conversation, I think you'd be a great addition to our team. Here's what I'd like to do next: [explain process—background check, offer letter, orientation]. Does that sound good to you?"

**If You Need to Think:**

"Thanks for your time today. I really enjoyed learning about your background. Let me review everything with my team, and I'll get back to you by [specific date] with next steps."
