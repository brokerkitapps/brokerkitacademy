Mastering Your Recruiting Calls

Successful recruiting calls are not just about making contact, but about making meaningful connections. Hone your craft and maximize your impact with these best practices:

**Role-Playing is Key:** The best way to prepare is to practice. Engage in role-playing exercises to refine your pitch, anticipate objections, and build confidence before you dial.

[​Consider Maverickre for call role playing & coaching​](https://www.maverickre.com/)

**Warm Leads Win:** The techniques we've discussed for generating warm leads based on levels of intent will result in your most productive calls. Focus on these high-potential connections.

**Reason Over Cold:** Prioritize calls that have a clear reason and context over pure cold calls. Having a foundational understanding of the agent's needs or interests transforms a sales call into a valuable conversation.

**Handle Objections:** Define objection handlers for common objections and role play them.

**Talk Time:** They should be talking 60%+ of the call. Focus on discovery questions to get them to talk through their pains vs. pitching them.
