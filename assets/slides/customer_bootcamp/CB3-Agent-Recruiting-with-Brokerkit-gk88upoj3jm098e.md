Effective Outbound Recruiting Outreach

To truly connect with agents in outbound recruiting, shift your focus from generic self-promotion to messages that address their pain points or offer compelling hooks. This approach triggers an emotional response, leading to significantly higher engagement.

Pain/Hook Focused

Self-Praise

Leads to your solution

Highlights specific problem

Evokes emotional response

Addresses agent challenges

For example, instead of listing your brokerage's virtues, ask: **"Are you struggling to generate enough leads from your sphere of influence?"** Then, present your unique marketing services, lead generation programs, or coaching as the direct solution to their problem.

Outbound Recruiting - Importing your lists

Outbound Prospect Sources

Identify potential agents from

Real estate schools

New licensee reports

Events

MLS Data Integration (Relitix, MarketView Broker,…)

Transaction-based lists - coops/cobrokes and closings

Avatar-based lists filtered by geography and production.

Segment your list down to avatars to target

Segment your list w/ filters

Label ~500-1000 recruiting leads aligning to target avatars

Block your calendar in the morning for 30 minutes

Contacting 10 agents/day will touch them every 3-6 months

Define your outreach plan

Outreach principles to Land Your Perfect Agents

Build and manage relationships

Start conversations in person or via BK outreach

Log notes and set follow up tasks in Brokerkit after conversations

~70% on cold outreach will say I am happy where I am or it is not a good time

It might actually not be a good time

This just means you need to follow up and build trust

Track your pipeline of ideal candidates

Multi-channel outreach

In person

Call

Social

Video emails

Email

Direct Mail

Text/video texts (Best for follow up and signup opt-ins)

Multi-touch outreach

Informational outreach:

Marketing/HTML style emails

Best practices (videos)

Invite to educational/social events

Conversational outreach:

Short text based emails with 2-3 sentences and end on a question (CTA)

3-5 touches if reaching out every 3-6 months to list

8-10 touches over time across channels

Lead with pain/hook focused messaging vs. pitching with a unique pain/hook in each in each vs. a long list of points on how great you are.

Intent & Event driven outreach = Higher Response Rate

Intent Triggers

Inbound leads - job posts, ads

Event signups

Email engagement

Video views

Document views

Event Driven - Their Milestones

Event follow up

Effective Outbound Recruiting Outreach

❌ What's Not Working

Relying solely on **email-only outreach** for agent recruiting often leads to low engagement and missed opportunities.

Limited personalization

Easy to ignore or filter

Lack of immediate interaction

Doesn't build rapport effectively

✅ What's Working Best

A multi-channel, personalized approach builds stronger connections and yields higher response rates.

Events

Host or attend industry events to meet agents face-to-face.

Calls

Personalized phone calls enable direct conversations and immediate feedback.

Leverage Intent Triggers

Reach out based on real-time triggers, like new licensee alerts or transaction activity.

Social Media

Engage on platforms like LinkedIn with targeted messages and content.

Video Messaging

Personalized video emails or texts cut through the noise and show genuine effort.

Sample daily routines with target list (alerts, avatar list)

1

Approach 1

**Day 1:**

Engage with the posts on social media (likes, comments)

**Day 3:**

Send social connection request

**Day 5:**

Call agent and leave a voicemail if missed

**Day 7:**

Follow up with text

**Day 9:**

Email if did not connect

2

Approach 2

**Day 1:**

Engage with the posts on social media (likes, comments)

**Day 1:**

Send social connection request

**Day 3:**

Send personal 1:1 video

Call on watch notifications

**Day 5:**

Send follow up email

**Day 7:**

Text if don't reach

Block your calendar for 30+ minutes/day

Reach out to 10+ agents/day - touch 1k people every 6 months

Consider warming up a few times first - e.g. congrats on closings

Potentially turn approach 1/2 into a campaign once you have a good rhythm
