# **Your LinkedIn Recruiting Playbook: A Guide for Brokerboost Customers**

Welcome to Brokerboost Accelerate\! This playbook is designed to help you maximize your recruiting efforts on LinkedIn. It's broken into two key parts: optimizing your digital presence to make a powerful first impression, and effectively managing follow-ups to turn new connections into recruiting conversations.

### **Part 1: Optimizing Your LinkedIn Presence**

When our team sends connection requests and messages on your behalf, prospective agents will inevitably visit your personal and company profiles. A strong, informative, and engaging LinkedIn presence validates our outreach, builds immediate trust, and significantly increases the likelihood of a positive response.

#### **How to Create a LinkedIn Company Page (If you don't have one)**

1. Click the **For Business** icon in the top-right corner of your LinkedIn homepage.  
2. Select **Create a Company Page**.  
3. Choose **Company** from the list of page types.  
4. Enter your company name, a public URL for your page (e.g., linkedin.com/company/your-brokerage-name), and your website address.  
5. Fill in the industry, company size, and company type.  
6. Upload your company logo.  
7. Click the checkbox to verify you are an authorized representative.  
8. Click **Create page**.

#### **Optimizing Your Company Page**

A complete and active Company Page is essential. Here’s what to focus on:

* **Profile & Cover Photos:**  
  * **Logo:** Upload a high-resolution version of your brokerage's logo. This is the icon people see everywhere.  
  * **Cover Image (1128 x 191 pixels):** This is prime real estate. Use a high-quality image that reflects your brand. Ideas include: a team photo, a branded graphic with your recruiting slogan, or a professional shot of your office.  
* **"About" Section:**  
  * This is your elevator pitch. In the first sentence, clearly state what you do and who you serve.  
  * Use the rest of the space to detail your brokerage's mission, values, and what makes you unique. Speak directly to potential recruits: mention your culture, training programs, technology, lead generation, or commission structure.  
  * Use keywords that agents might search for, such as "real estate brokerage," "\[Your City\] real estate," and "top-producing agents."  
* **Showcase That You're Hiring:**  
  * LinkedIn allows you to activate a "Hiring" feature on your company page and personal profile, which adds a purple banner and attracts job-seekers.  
  * **To activate:** From your personal profile, click the **Open to** button below your name and select **Hiring**. Follow the prompts to connect it to your Company Page and create a job post. Even creating a general "Real Estate Agent" posting can capture inbound interest.

### **Part 2: Your Personal LinkedIn Profile**

As the face of the recruiting effort, your personal profile needs to be just as compelling as your company page.

#### **Connect Your Profile to Your Company Page**

Ensure your current role at the brokerage is correctly linked to your Company Page.

1. Go to your personal profile.  
2. Scroll down to the **Experience** section and click the pencil icon to edit your current role.  
3. In the **Company name** field, start typing your company's name and select it from the dropdown menu when it appears. This will display the company logo next to your role.  
4. Click **Save**.

#### **Key Personal Profile Optimizations**

* **Profile Photo & Header Image:**  
  * **Profile Photo:** Use a professional, high-quality headshot where you look friendly and approachable.  
  * **Header Image (1584 x 396 pixels):** Use this space to reinforce your recruiting message. Include your company logo, a call to action like "We're Hiring\!", or your contact information.  
* **Headline:**  
  * Your headline appears everywhere with your name. Don't just list your title. Create a value-driven headline that speaks to agents.  
  * *Example:* Instead of "Broker/Owner at \[Brokerage Name\]," try: "Helping Real Estate Agents Build Wealth and Achieve Their Goals at \[Brokerage Name\] | We're Hiring\!"  
* **"About" Summary:**  
  * Write this in the first person. Tell your story and explain why you're passionate about helping agents succeed.  
  * Clearly articulate the benefits of joining your brokerage. What problems do you solve for agents? (e.g., providing leads, offering better splits, mentorship, technology, etc.).  
  * End with a clear call to action: "If you're looking to take your real estate career to the next level, send me a private message or visit our careers page here: \[Link\]."  
* **Posting & Engagement:**  
  * Share content that is valuable to real estate agents. This could be market updates, sales tips, success stories of agents at your brokerage, or posts about your company culture.  
  * Regularly posting establishes you as a thought leader and keeps you top-of-mind. Your Brokerboost campaign includes AI-powered "likes" and comments on prospects' posts, but your own organic activity is the perfect complement to build authentic relationships.

### **Part 3: Managing Follow-Up on Your New LinkedIn Connections**

Once an agent accepts your connection request and replies to our initial automated message, it's your turn to step in. Your goal is to build rapport, understand their needs, and guide the conversation toward a meeting. This is a relationship-building process, not a hard sell.

Here is a step-by-step cadence to follow.

#### **Step 1: The Initial Response – Build Rapport**

When an agent replies to the first message, your immediate goal is to start a genuine conversation.

1. **Acknowledge and Engage:** Thank them for connecting. Keep it light and conversational.  
2. **Ask an Easy, Open-Ended Question:** Don't jump straight to business. Ask a question to get the conversation flowing.  
   * *Example:* "Thanks for connecting, \[Agent's Name\]\! Great to meet another pro in the Florida market. How has your year been so far?"  
   * *Example:* "Hi \[Agent's Name\], appreciate the connection. I see you do a lot of business in \[Their City\]. How's the market treating you over there?"

**Brokerkit Pro-Tip:** As soon as they reply, go into your Brokerkit account, find their profile, and create a task to follow up in 2-3 days if you don't hear back. This ensures no one slips through the cracks.

#### **Step 2: Uncover Needs & Pain Points**

Once they respond, use discovery questions to understand their situation. Ask one question at a time. The goal is to identify what challenges they're facing or what they're missing in their current role.

**Good Discovery Questions:**

* "What do you enjoy most about where you're at currently?" (This helps you understand their values).  
* "What's been the biggest challenge for you in the business lately?"  
* "If you could wave a magic wand, what's one thing you'd change about your current brokerage support?"  
* "What are you focused on for growth in the next 12 months?"

Listen for common agent pain points:

* Needing more or better quality leads.  
* Lack of training, mentorship, or support.  
* Frustration with company culture.  
* Outdated technology.  
* Unfavorable commission splits or fees.

#### **Step 3: The Pivot – Connect Their Pain to Your Solution**

When they share a challenge, you have the perfect opening.

1. **Acknowledge and Empathize:** Show them you understand.  
   * *Example:* "Ah, I hear that a lot. It can be really frustrating when you feel like you don't have the right tech to support your business."  
2. **Introduce Your Solution:** Briefly explain how your brokerage solves their specific problem. This shouldn't be a sales pitch, but a helpful suggestion.  
   * *Example:* "That's actually a big reason we invested in \[Your CRM/Tech Platform\]. We wanted to give our agents a seamless system to save them time."  
   * *Example:* "I totally get that. We built our mentorship program to make sure every agent, new or experienced, has a clear path for growth."  
3. **Gauge Interest:** Ask a simple question to see if they're open to learning more.  
   * *Example:* "Would you be open to hearing a bit about how we handle that?"

#### **Step 4: The Ask – Secure the Meeting**

If they express interest, it's time to move the conversation offline.

* **Frame it as a no-pressure chat:** "I'd be happy to share a bit more. I'm not trying to sell you anything, but I'm passionate about what we're building and enjoy connecting with other sharp agents. Would you be open to a brief, informal chat next week to see if there might be a fit?"  
* **Make it easy to schedule:** "If so, here’s a link to my calendar to find a time that works for you: \[Link\]. Let me know once you find a spot."

#### **What If the Conversation Stalls?**

If an agent replies once but then goes quiet, don't give up. They're busy. Here’s a simple follow-up plan:

* **Follow-Up 1 (3-4 days later):** "Hey \[Agent's Name\], I know how busy things can get. Just wanted to follow up on our chat. Let me know if you're still open to connecting."  
* **Follow-Up 2 (1 week later):** "Hey again, \[Agent's Name\]. I know things are crazy out there. Want me to leave you alone? No problem at all if so\!" (This often gets a response due to its direct and respectful nature).

By following this playbook, you'll be well-equipped to turn your Brokerboost connections into meaningful recruiting opportunities.
