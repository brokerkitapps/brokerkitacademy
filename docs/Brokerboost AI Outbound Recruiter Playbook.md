## **Understanding Your AI Outbound Recruiter Service**

### **How It Works**

**Laura** is your AI outbound recruiter—a fully managed, done-for-you recruiting service that combines cutting-edge data enrichment, AI-powered personalization, and multi-channel outreach to generate qualified recruiting conversations for your brokerage. Laura handles all the heavy lifting of initial outreach so you can focus on what you do best: building relationships and closing deals.

#### **1. Agent Data Sourcing**

We start by identifying the right agents in your market(s):

- **MLS Integration:** Your Brokerkit account pulls agent data from your local MLS through integrations like Relitix or other agent data providers
- **Multi-Market Support:** Whether you recruit in one market or multiple markets, we import all relevant agent data
- **Production Data:** We capture each agent's sales history, including transactions and production volume over the last 12 months

#### **2. Targeting Your Ideal Agent Avatar**

Not all agents are created equal. We help you focus on the agents most likely to join your brokerage:

- **Mid-Producing Agents:** Agents with proven track records who are actively growing their business
- **Production Thresholds:** Target agents who have closed a specific number of transactions or dollar volume in the last 12 months
- **Custom Criteria:** Define your ideal agent profile based on experience level, market area, property type specialization, and more

#### **3. Data Enrichment with Full Contact**

Once we've identified your target agents, we enrich their profiles:

- **Bulk Social Media Discovery:** We use Full Contact to pull social media profiles for all targeted agents in your database
- **LinkedIn Focus:** We prioritize LinkedIn profiles as the primary outreach channel for professional recruiting
- **Profile Upload:** All enriched social data is automatically uploaded to your Brokerkit account for easy access

#### **4. AI-Powered Multi-Channel Cadence**

Laura engages agents across multiple touchpoints on your behalf:

**LinkedIn Outreach:**
- **Connection Request:** Laura sends a personalized connection request on your behalf
- **Automated Follow-Up:** When they accept, Laura automatically sends personalized LinkedIn messages
- **Ongoing Engagement:** Laura runs a multi-touch LinkedIn messaging sequence designed to generate responses

**Email Outreach:**
- **Personalized Emails:** Laura writes and sends AI-personalized emails in parallel with LinkedIn outreach
- **Profile-Based Content:** Laura's messages reference information from each agent's LinkedIn profile
- **Agent Alert Integration:** For brokerages with Relitix integration, Laura can reference recent agent alerts (new listings, closings, price changes) to make outreach even more timely and relevant

#### **5. Personalization at Scale**

Laura personalizes every message using:
- Information from the agent's LinkedIn profile (recent posts, career milestones, shared connections)
- Their production data and transaction history
- Recent listing activity and agent alerts (closings, new listings) when Relitix integration is available
- Market-specific insights and local trends

#### **6. Your Role: The Human Touch**

While Laura handles the outreach automation, **you bring the relationship-building that closes the deal**:

- **Call Tasks:** When agents engage with Laura's outreach, you'll receive call tasks in Brokerkit to follow up by phone
- **LinkedIn Conversations:** You'll need to step in and continue conversations when agents respond to Laura on LinkedIn
- **Meeting Setting:** Your goal is to convert the interested agents Laura finds into phone calls or in-person meetings

## **Part 1: Optimizing Your LinkedIn Presence**

When Laura sends connection requests and messages on your behalf, prospective agents will inevitably visit your personal and company profiles. A strong, informative, and engaging LinkedIn presence validates Laura's outreach, builds immediate trust, and significantly increases the likelihood of a positive response.

### **How to Create a LinkedIn Company Page (If you don't have one)**

1. Click the **For Business** icon in the top-right corner of your LinkedIn homepage.
2. Select **Create a Company Page**.
3. Choose **Company** from the list of page types.
4. Enter your company name, a public URL for your page (e.g., linkedin.com/company/your-brokerage-name), and your website address.
5. Fill in the industry, company size, and company type.
6. Upload your company logo.
7. Click the checkbox to verify you are an authorized representative.
8. Click **Create page**.

### **Optimizing Your Company Page**

A complete and active Company Page is essential. Here's what to focus on:

- **Profile & Cover Photos:**
  - **Logo:** Upload a high-resolution version of your brokerage's logo. This is the icon people see everywhere.
  - **Cover Image (1128 x 191 pixels):** This is prime real estate. Use a high-quality image that reflects your brand. Ideas include: a team photo, a branded graphic with your recruiting slogan, or a professional shot of your office.
- **"About" Section:**
  - This is your elevator pitch. In the first sentence, clearly state what you do and who you serve.
  - Use the rest of the space to detail your brokerage's mission, values, and what makes you unique. Speak directly to potential recruits: mention your culture, training programs, technology, lead generation, or commission structure.
  - Use keywords that agents might search for, such as "real estate brokerage," "[Your City] real estate," and "top-producing agents."
- **Showcase That You're Hiring:**
  - LinkedIn allows you to activate a "Hiring" feature on your company page and personal profile, which adds a purple banner and attracts job-seekers.
  - **To activate:** From your personal profile, click the **Open to** button below your name and select **Hiring**. Follow the prompts to connect it to your Company Page and create a job post. Even creating a general "Real Estate Agent" posting can capture inbound interest.

---

## **Part 2: Your Personal LinkedIn Profile**

As the face of the recruiting effort, your personal profile needs to be just as compelling as your company page.

### **Connect Your Profile to Your Company Page**

Ensure your current role at the brokerage is correctly linked to your Company Page.

1. Go to your personal profile.
2. Scroll down to the **Experience** section and click the pencil icon to edit your current role.
3. In the **Company name** field, start typing your company's name and select it from the dropdown menu when it appears. This will display the company logo next to your role.
4. Click **Save**.

### **Key Personal Profile Optimizations**

- **Profile Photo & Header Image:**
  - **Profile Photo:** Use a professional, high-quality headshot where you look friendly and approachable.
  - **Header Image (1584 x 396 pixels):** Use this space to reinforce your recruiting message. Include your company logo, a call to action like "We're Hiring!", or your contact information.
- **Headline:**
  - Your headline appears everywhere with your name. Don't just list your title. Create a value-driven headline that speaks to agents.
  - *Example:* Instead of "Broker/Owner at [Brokerage Name]," try: "Helping Real Estate Agents Build Wealth and Achieve Their Goals at [Brokerage Name] | We're Hiring!"
- **"About" Summary:**
  - Write this in the first person. Tell your story and explain why you're passionate about helping agents succeed.
  - Clearly articulate the benefits of joining your brokerage. What problems do you solve for agents? (e.g., providing leads, offering better splits, mentorship, technology, etc.).
  - End with a clear call to action: "If you're looking to take your real estate career to the next level, send me a private message or visit our careers page here: [Link]."
- **Posting & Engagement:**
  - Share content that is valuable to real estate agents. This could be market updates, sales tips, success stories of agents at your brokerage, or posts about your company culture.
  - Regularly posting establishes you as a thought leader and keeps you top-of-mind. Your Brokerboost campaign includes AI-powered "likes" and comments on prospects' posts, but your own organic activity is the perfect complement to build authentic relationships.

## **Part 3: Managing Follow-Up on LinkedIn**

Once an agent accepts your connection request and replies to Laura's initial automated message, it's your turn to step in. Your goal is to build rapport, understand their needs, and guide the conversation toward a meeting. This is a relationship-building process, not a hard sell.

Here is a step-by-step cadence to follow.

### **Step 1: The Initial Response – Build Rapport**

When an agent replies to the first message, your immediate goal is to start a genuine conversation.

1. **Acknowledge and Engage:** Thank them for connecting. Keep it light and conversational.
2. **Ask an Easy, Open-Ended Question:** Don't jump straight to business. Ask a question to get the conversation flowing.
   - *Example:* "Thanks for connecting, [Agent's Name]! Great to meet another pro in the Florida market. How has your year been so far?"
   - *Example:* "Hi [Agent's Name], appreciate the connection. I see you do a lot of business in [Their City]. How's the market treating you over there?"

**Brokerkit Pro-Tip:** As soon as they reply, go into your Brokerkit account, find their profile, and create a task to follow up in 2-3 days if you don't hear back. This ensures no one slips through the cracks.

### **Step 2: Uncover Needs & Pain Points**

Once they respond, use discovery questions to understand their situation. Ask one question at a time. The goal is to identify what challenges they're facing or what they're missing in their current role.

**Good Discovery Questions:**

- "What do you enjoy most about where you're at currently?" (This helps you understand their values).
- "What's been the biggest challenge for you in the business lately?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what's one thing you'd change about your current brokerage support?"
- "What are you focused on for growth in the next 12 months?"

Listen for common agent pain points:

- Needing more or better quality leads.
- Lack of training, mentorship, or support.
- Frustration with company culture.
- Outdated technology.
- Unfavorable commission splits or fees.

### **Step 3: The Pivot – Connect Their Pain to Your Solution**

When they share a challenge, you have the perfect opening.

1. **Acknowledge and Empathize:** Show them you understand.
   - *Example:* "Ah, I hear that a lot. It can be really frustrating when you feel like you don't have the right tech to support your business."
2. **Introduce Your Solution:** Briefly explain how your brokerage solves their specific problem. This shouldn't be a sales pitch, but a helpful suggestion.
   - *Example:* "That's actually a big reason we invested in [Your CRM/Tech Platform]. We wanted to give our agents a seamless system to save them time."
   - *Example:* "I totally get that. We built our mentorship program to make sure every agent, new or experienced, has a clear path for growth."
3. **Gauge Interest:** Ask a simple question to see if they're open to learning more.
   - *Example:* "Would you be open to hearing a bit about how we handle that?"

### **Step 4: The Ask – Secure the Meeting**

If they express interest, it's time to move the conversation offline.

- **Frame it as a no-pressure chat:** "I'd be happy to share a bit more. I'm not trying to sell you anything, but I'm passionate about what we're building and enjoy connecting with other sharp agents. Would you be open to a brief, informal chat next week to see if there might be a fit?"
- **Make it easy to schedule:** "If so, here's a link to my calendar to find a time that works for you: [Link]. Let me know once you find a spot."

### **What If the Conversation Stalls?**

If an agent replies once but then goes quiet, don't give up. They're busy. Here's a simple follow-up plan:

- **Follow-Up 1 (3-4 days later):** "Hey [Agent's Name], I know how busy things can get. Just wanted to follow up on our chat. Let me know if you're still open to connecting."
- **Follow-Up 2 (1 week later):** "Hey again, [Agent's Name]. I know things are crazy out there. Want me to leave you alone? No problem at all if so!" (This often gets a response due to its direct and respectful nature).

## **Part 4: Handling Your Call Tasks in Brokerkit**

When agents engage with Laura's outreach (opening emails, clicking links, accepting LinkedIn connections, or replying to messages), Laura generates **call tasks** in your Brokerkit account. These are your hottest leads—agents who have shown interest and are ready for a personal conversation.

### **What Are Call Tasks?**

Call tasks are action items that appear in your Brokerkit dashboard when an agent takes a meaningful action:

- Accepts your LinkedIn connection request
- Replies to a LinkedIn message
- Opens or clicks links in emails
- Shows engagement signals that indicate recruiting interest

Each call task includes:
- Agent's name and contact information
- Their production history and transaction data
- Notes about their engagement (what they clicked, when they responded)
- LinkedIn profile and recent activity
- Any recent agent alerts (closings, new listings) if you have Relitix integration

### **Prioritizing Your Call Tasks**

Not all call tasks are equal. Prioritize based on:

1. **Recency:** Call the most recent responders first (same day if possible)
2. **Engagement Level:** Agents who replied to messages > Agents who accepted connections > Agents who only opened emails
3. **Production Level:** Focus on your ideal agent avatar (mid-producers in your target range)
4. **Recent Activity:** Agents with recent closings or new listings (shown in agent alerts) may be more receptive

### **Best Times to Call Real Estate Agents**

Timing matters. Avoid these times:
- Early mornings (before 9 AM) – agents may be preparing for showings
- Mid-day weekends (Saturday/Sunday 10 AM - 4 PM) – busy with showings and open houses
- Late evenings (after 8 PM) – personal time

**Best times to reach agents:**
- **Weekday mornings:** 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Weekday late afternoons:** 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- **Early weekday evenings:** 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM
- **Sunday evenings:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM (reflecting on the week ahead)

### **Preparing Before Your Call**

Before dialing, spend 2-3 minutes reviewing in Brokerkit:

- ✅ Agent's production history (last 12 months)
- ✅ Recent agent alerts (closings, new listings, price changes)
- ✅ Their LinkedIn profile (recent posts, career highlights)
- ✅ What message they responded to (so you can reference it)
- ✅ Their brokerage affiliation and market area

**Set yourself up for success:**
- Have their Brokerkit profile open on your screen
- Keep a notepad or CRM notes ready to log the conversation
- Be in a quiet environment free from distractions
- Have your calendar link ready to send if they're interested in meeting

## **Part 5: Agent Recruiting Call Scripts**

### **Script 1: Initial Outreach Call (For Call Tasks)**

Use this script when calling an agent who engaged with your outreach but hasn't had a direct conversation with you yet.

---

**Introduction:**

*"Hi [Agent's Name], this is [Your Name] with [Your Brokerage]. How are you doing today?"*

*[Wait for response]*

*"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you [accepted my LinkedIn connection / opened my email / replied to my message]. I know you're probably busy, so I'll be quick—do you have just two minutes?"*

---

**Build Rapport:**

*"First, I wanted to say congratulations on [recent closing/new listing from agent alert if applicable]. That's a great property in [neighborhood]. How did that come about?"*

*[Listen and engage authentically]*

---

**Discovery:**

*"I'm always curious about what's working well for successful agents like you. Can I ask—what do you like most about your current brokerage situation?"*

*[Listen carefully—this tells you what they value]*

*"That's great. And on the flip side, if there was one thing you could change or improve about your current setup, what would it be?"*

*[Listen for pain points: leads, tech, splits, support, culture, training]*

---

**The Pivot:**

*"I appreciate you sharing that. You know, [acknowledge their pain point]—that's actually one of the biggest reasons I reached out. We've been focusing a lot on [your solution to their pain point] at [Your Brokerage], and it's made a huge difference for our agents."*

*"I'm not calling to pitch you or sell you anything today, but I'd love to learn more about what you're working on and share a bit about what we're doing here. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute conversation sometime this week or next?"*

---

**Closing:**

- **If YES:** *"Awesome! Let me send you a link to my calendar—it'll show my availability and you can grab a time that works for you. Does that work?"*
  - Send calendar link via text or email immediately after the call
  - *"Perfect, I just sent it to you. Looking forward to connecting!"*

- **If NOT NOW:** *"No problem at all! I totally get it—timing isn't always right. Can I stay in touch and maybe circle back in a few months when things settle down?"*
  - Log a follow-up task in Brokerkit for 60-90 days

- **If NOT INTERESTED:** *"I completely understand, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. Hey, if anything changes down the road, feel free to reach out. And if you know any agents who might be a fit, I'd love an introduction. Best of luck with everything!"*

---

### **Script 2: Follow-Up Call (For LinkedIn Responders)**

Use this script when an agent has already engaged in conversation on LinkedIn, and you're calling to continue the dialogue.

---

**Introduction:**

*"Hi [Agent's Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Brokerage]. We've been chatting a bit on LinkedIn—do you have a quick minute to talk?"*

*[Wait for response]*

---

**Reference the LinkedIn Conversation:**

*"Thanks! So in our LinkedIn chat, you mentioned [reference something specific they said, like 'you've been frustrated with lead quality' or 'you're looking for better tech support']. I wanted to dive a bit deeper into that if you're open to it."*

---

**Ask Follow-Up Discovery Questions:**

*"When you say [their pain point], what does that look like day-to-day for you? Can you give me an example?"*

*[Listen and probe deeper]*

*"And how long has this been an issue? Is it something you've brought up with your current broker?"*

*[Listen—this reveals if they're actively looking or just casually exploring]*

---

**Introduce Your Value Proposition:**

*"I really appreciate you sharing that. Look, what we're doing at [Your Brokerage] is [explain how you solve their specific problem]. For example, [share a brief success story or stat]."*

*"I think there could be a great fit here, but I'd rather show you than tell you. Can we set up a time to meet—either over coffee or a quick Zoom—so I can walk you through what we offer and you can decide if it makes sense for you?"*

---

**Closing:**

*"I promise it'll be low-pressure and informative. Even if it's not the right fit right now, I think you'll get some value out of the conversation. How does [suggest two specific time slots] work for you?"*

- **If YES:** Confirm the meeting and send a calendar invite immediately
- **If NOT NOW:** Same follow-up approach as Script 1

---

### **Script 3: Objection Handling**

Agents will raise objections. Here's how to handle the most common ones:

---

**Objection: "I'm happy where I'm at."**

*"That's great to hear! I'm not calling to pull you away from something that's working. I'm just curious—is there anything about your current setup that, if you could improve it, would make your business even better?"*

*[Listen for even small pain points, then explore further]*

---

**Objection: "I'm too busy to talk right now."**

*"I completely understand—I know how crazy the market can be. Would it be better if I called you back at a different time? Or I can send you my calendar link and you can grab a time that works best for you?"*

---

**Objection: "I'm under contract / I signed a non-compete."**

*"Got it. No worries at all. When does that wrap up?"*

*[Note the date and set a follow-up task in Brokerkit]*

*"Cool. Let's stay in touch. I'll reach back out around that time, and if you're open to it, we can connect then. Sound good?"*

---

**Objection: "What's your commission split?"**

*"Great question. Our splits are competitive and depend on your production level and what support you're looking for. But honestly, I've found that the best agents care less about splits and more about net income at the end of the year. Can I ask—what are you netting right now after all your brokerage fees and expenses?"*

*[This shifts the conversation from splits to total value]*

*"Our model is built around [leads, support, tech, etc.], which is why our agents often net more even if the split looks similar on paper. That's something I'd love to walk you through in more detail. Does that sound interesting?"*

---

**Objection: "I need to think about it."**

*"Totally fair. I'm not asking you to make a decision today—I'm just asking if you'd be open to a no-obligation conversation to learn more. What specifically do you need to think about? Maybe I can help clarify."*

*[Address their concern directly]*

---

### **Script 4: Booking the Meeting**

Once an agent expresses interest, lock down the meeting with confidence:

---

*"Awesome! I'm glad you're open to it. Here's what I'd like to do: let's set up a quick 15-20 minute call where I can learn more about your business and share what we're building here. No pressure—just a conversation to see if there's a mutual fit. Sound good?"*

*"I'll shoot you my calendar link right now via [text/email]. Grab any time that works for you, and I'll send you a confirmation. If anything changes, just let me know. Deal?"*

---

**After the Call:**
1. Send the calendar link immediately (via text or email)
2. Log detailed notes in Brokerkit
3. Set a follow-up reminder if they don't book within 24 hours
4. Send a personalized LinkedIn message thanking them for the call

---

## **Part 6: Multi-Channel Follow-Up Strategy**

Laura reaches agents through LinkedIn and email, but **you control the phone follow-up**. The key to success is coordinating all three channels for maximum impact.

### **When to Use Each Channel**

| **Channel** | **Best For** | **Timing** |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **LinkedIn Message** | Warm, conversational engagement; sharing resources; staying top-of-mind | Immediate responses; ongoing nurturing |
| **Phone Call** | Building rapport quickly; handling objections; closing for meetings | When they engage with outreach (same day if possible) |
| **Email** | Sending calendar links; sharing documents; formal follow-ups | After phone conversations; as scheduled reminders |

### **The Multi-Touch Follow-Up Sequence**

Use this sequence when an agent engages with your outreach:

**Day 1:**
- Agent accepts LinkedIn connection or responds to message
- Call them the same day (use Script 1 or 2)
- If no answer, leave a brief voicemail and send a LinkedIn message referencing your call

**Day 3:**
- If no response to call, send a follow-up LinkedIn message
- Reference something specific from their profile or recent activity

**Day 7:**
- Make a second call attempt at a different time of day
- Send a short email: "Hi [Agent's Name], I've tried reaching you a couple of times. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. [One sentence value prop]. Here's my calendar if you'd like to connect: [Link]."

**Day 14:**
- Send a final LinkedIn message with a direct question: "Hey [Agent's Name], want me to stop bugging you? No hard feelings if the timing isn't right!"
- This "permission to stop" message often gets a response

**Day 30+:**
- If still no response, log them as "not now" and set a 90-day follow-up task
- Continue engaging with their LinkedIn posts (likes, comments) to stay top-of-mind

### **Tracking Multi-Channel Conversations in Brokerkit**

Stay organized by logging every touchpoint in Brokerkit:

1. **After Every Call:** Log notes in the agent's profile
   - What you discussed
   - Their pain points
   - Next steps

2. **After Every LinkedIn Exchange:** Add a note summarizing the conversation

3. **Set Tasks for Follow-Ups:** Never rely on memory
   - If they say "call me in 3 months," set a task for 90 days from now
   - If they book a meeting, set a reminder for 24 hours before to confirm

4. **Tag Agents by Status:**
   - Hot Lead (ready to meet)
   - Warm Lead (interested but timing not right)
   - Nurture (not ready, follow up in 90 days)
   - Not Interested (respect their decision)

---

## **Final Thoughts: Your Recipe for Recruiting Success**

Laura is powerful, but she's only as effective as your follow-up. Here's your recipe for success:

1. **Optimize your LinkedIn presence** (Parts 1 & 2) to validate Laura's automated outreach
2. **Respond quickly to engagement** – same-day follow-up doubles your response rate
3. **Use the phone** – LinkedIn and email are great for initial contact, but the phone builds real relationships
4. **Be consultative, not salesy** – position yourself as a resource, not a recruiter
5. **Stay organized in Brokerkit** – log every interaction and set follow-up tasks religiously
6. **Play the long game** – not every agent will join today, but staying top-of-mind wins over time

By combining Laura's AI-powered outreach with your authentic relationship-building, you'll create a steady pipeline of high-quality recruiting conversations that grow your brokerage.

Now go get 'em!
