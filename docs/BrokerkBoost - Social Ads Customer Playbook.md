# **Brokerboost Social Ads Playbook**

Welcome to Brokerboost Social Ads! This comprehensive playbook will help you maximize results from your Facebook and Instagram recruiting campaigns. You'll learn how the social ads channel works, how to manage incoming inquiries, and most importantly, how to effectively follow up and convert interested agents into new team members.

---

## **Understanding Your Social Ads Channel**

### **How It Works**

Brokerboost Social Ads runs targeted advertising campaigns on your Meta business pages (Facebook and Instagram) to generate recruiting conversations with both licensed real estate agents and candidates interested in entering the industry.

#### **1. Campaign Setup and Targeting**

We handle the entire campaign creation and management:

- **Professional Creative:** We design eye-catching ads with your branding, office photos, and compelling messaging
- **Multi-Ad Variations:** We create and test multiple ad versions to optimize performance
- **Smart Targeting:** We target two primary audiences:
  - **Retargeting:** Leads already in your Broker kit recruiting pipeline
  - **Prospecting:** Licensed real estate agents and real estate-interested audiences in your market
- **Platform Coverage:** Ads appear on both Facebook and Instagram feeds, stories, and placements
- **Continuous Optimization:** We monitor performance and adjust targeting and creative monthly

#### **2. Lead Generation Flow**

When someone sees your ad and is interested:

**Step 1: They Click "Apply Now" / "Learn More"**
- The ad appears in their Facebook or Instagram feed
- They click the call-to-action button

**Step 2: In-Platform Form**
- A short form opens directly within Facebook/Instagram
- They provide basic information:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone number
- No resume required (unlike job ads)
- Takes 30 seconds or less to complete

**Step 3: Automatic Import to Brokerkit**
- The moment they submit, they're created as a new contact in Brokerkit
- Source is tagged as "social ads"
- Platform attribution shows whether they came from Facebook or Instagram
- Round-robin assignment (if configured)

#### **3. What Makes Social Ad Leads Different**

Social ad leads have unique characteristics:

**Pros:**
- Often already licensed and producing agents
- Higher quality than general job board applicants
- Demonstrated interest by clicking through
- Familiarity with your brand/company from the ad

**Cons:**
- May have been casually browsing (not actively job hunting)
- Sometimes don't remember submitting the form
- May be exploring options vs. ready to move
- Competition is likely reaching out to them too

#### **4. Automated Follow-Up Campaigns**

For all social ad leads, an automated campaign is triggered:

- **Email Sequence:** Personalized emails introducing your team and value proposition
- **Text Messages:** SMS follow-up to increase response rates
- **Calendar Links:** Easy scheduling for discovery calls
- **Task Generation:** Call tasks created for your recruiting team
- **Engagement Tracking:** Visibility into opens, clicks, and interest signals

#### **5. Your Role: The Relationship Builder**

While Brokerboost handles ad creation, targeting, and initial follow-up, **you bring the human touch that converts interested agents**:

- **Timely Response:** Contact inquiries within 24-48 hours
- **Consultative Approach:** These are explorers, not active job seekers—be helpful, not pushy
- **Discovery Conversations:** Uncover their pain points and motivations
- **Build Trust:** Position yourself as a resource, not just a recruiter
- **Stay Persistent:** Multiple touches are necessary—most won't respond to the first attempt

---

## **Part 1: Finding and Managing Your Social Ad Leads**

### **Three Ways to Access Your Leads**

#### **Method 1: Today Section (Easiest)**

The Today section in Brokerkit displays all new leads:

1. Log into Brokerkit
2. Click "Today" in the left navigation
3. View the "New Leads" section
4. All social ad leads will appear here with source "social ads"

#### **Method 2: Recruiting Agenda Email (Daily Digest)**

Receive a daily email summary of new leads and pending tasks:

1. Go to **User Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Check the box for "Recruiting Agenda"
3. Click "Update Notifications"
4. You'll receive a daily email each morning with new leads and tasks due

#### **Method 3: Advanced Filters (Most Powerful)**

For detailed searching and segmentation:

1. Click "Show advanced options" in the search area
2. Filter by **Source** field
3. Select "social ads"
4. Combine with other filters (date range, owner, status, etc.)
5. Save frequently-used filter combinations

### **Understanding Platform Attribution**

In each lead's Brokerkit profile, check the "Referrer Notes" section to see:

- Whether they came from **Facebook** or **Instagram**
- Which ad campaign they responded to
- Date and time of inquiry

**Why This Matters:**
- Instagram leads tend to be younger (25-40)
- Facebook leads tend to be more established (35-55)
- Helps you tailor your conversation and references

---

## **Part 2: Lead Prioritization and Contact Strategy**

### **Prioritizing Your Social Ad Leads**

Not all inquiries are equal. Prioritize based on:

1. **Recency:** Contact within 24-48 hours (same-day is ideal)
   - Social media users expect fast responses
   - They're likely exploring multiple options simultaneously

2. **Engagement Signals:**
   - Opened automated emails = higher interest
   - Clicked calendar link (but didn't book) = very high interest
   - Responded to texts = ready for conversation

3. **Timing of Inquiry:**
   - Weekday inquiries = may be at work, frustrated with current situation
   - Weekend inquiries = researching options, more exploratory
   - Evening inquiries = thinking about career while relaxing at home

4. **Retargeting vs. Prospecting:**
   - **Retargeting leads** (already in your pipeline) = warmer, higher priority
   - **Prospecting leads** (cold audience) = need more nurturing

### **Best Times to Contact Social Ad Leads**

Unlike job seekers, social ad leads are often currently employed agents, so timing matters:

**Best Times:**
- **Weekday late mornings:** 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM (between morning appointments)
- **Weekday mid-afternoons:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM (office time)
- **Weekday early evenings:** 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM (after showings, before family time)
- **Sunday evenings:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM (planning week ahead, reflective time)

**Avoid:**
- Early mornings before 10 AM (appointments and showings)
- Lunchtime (12-1 PM)
- Weekday evenings after 8 PM
- Saturday/Sunday mid-day (open houses and showings)

### **Pre-Call Preparation (2 Minutes)**

Before calling any social ad lead, review:

✅ Their inquiry date (how long have they been waiting?)
✅ Referrer Notes (Facebook or Instagram?)
✅ Which ad they responded to (review the creative and messaging)
✅ Any automated emails they've opened or links they've clicked
✅ Whether they're a retargeting lead (already in your pipeline) or cold audience

**Set yourself up for success:**
- Have their Brokerkit profile open
- Be in a quiet, professional environment
- Have your calendar link ready to share
- Review your company's key differentiators
- Prepare for the "I don't remember that ad" response

---

## **Part 3: Initial Contact Call Scripts**

### **Script 1: First Contact Call (Social Ad Inquiry)**

Use this script when calling someone who inquired through Facebook or Instagram:

---

**Introduction:**

*"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with [Your Brokerage]. How are you doing?"*

*[Wait for response]*

*"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you inquired about opportunities with our team through [Facebook/Instagram]. I know you're probably in the middle of your day, so I'll keep this quick—do you have just two or three minutes?"*

*[If they say "I don't remember filling that out" – see Objection Handling below]*

---

**If They Say Yes:**

*"Awesome, I appreciate it! So just to give you some quick context: You filled out a short form on one of our ads—we're currently growing our team and looking for sharp agents who want [your key value prop: better support/more leads/higher splits/etc.]."*

*"Can I ask—what caught your attention about our ad? What made you want to learn more?"*

*[Listen carefully—this reveals their pain point or desire]*

---

**Discovery Questions (Choose 2-3 Based on Their Answer):**

*"How long have you been in real estate?"*

*"What do you love most about where you're at currently?"*

*"What's been the biggest challenge for you in growing your business?"*

*"If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about your current brokerage, what would it be?"*

*"Are you actively looking to make a move, or more in the exploring phase?"*

*[Listen for: frustration with current brokerage, lack of leads, poor support, commission concerns, limited growth opportunity]*

---

**The Pivot (Connecting Their Pain to Your Solution):**

*"That's really helpful to know. You know, [acknowledge their pain point]—I hear that a lot from agents. That's actually one of the main reasons we've been growing. We focus on [your solution to their problem]."*

*"For example, [share brief specific example or success story]."*

*"Based on what you're sharing, I think there could be a really good fit here. But rather than tell you everything on this call, what I'd love to do is schedule a time where we can have a real conversation—no pressure, just exploring whether this makes sense for you. Would you be open to that?"*

---

**Closing:**

- **If YES:** *"Perfect! I'll send you a link to my calendar so you can grab a time that works best. What's better for you—text or email?"*
  - Send the link immediately
  - *"Great, just sent it over. Pick a time and I'll get a confirmation out to you. Looking forward to talking more!"*

- **If "LET ME THINK ABOUT IT":** *"Totally understand—no rush at all. Can I ask what you want to think about specifically? Maybe I can help clarify anything?"*
  - Address their concern
  - *"Makes sense. How about this: Let me send you my calendar link anyway, and if you decide you want to chat, you can grab a time. No obligation. Sound good?"*

- **If "NOT INTERESTED":** *"I completely understand, and I appreciate you being upfront. Just out of curiosity—is it bad timing, or is it just not a fit?"*
  - If timing: *"Got it. Can I reach back out in a few months when things settle down?"* (Set 90-day follow-up task)
  - If not a fit: *"No problem at all. Hey, if you know any agents who might be interested, I'd love an introduction. Either way, best of luck!"*

---

### **Script 2: Handling "I Don't Remember That Ad"**

This is THE most common response. Handle it smoothly and conversationally:

---

**The Smooth Response (Option A - Casual & Light):**

*"Oh yeah, I totally get that! You probably see a million things in your Facebook feed every day. Ours was the one about [reference the ad hook: better support/company-provided leads/100% commission/etc.]. You clicked through and filled out a quick form—took like 30 seconds."*

*[Pause briefly, stay upbeat]*

*"But hey, now that I have you—is this still something you're curious about? Or did I catch you at a time when you're focused on other things?"*

---

**The Smooth Response (Option B - More Direct):**

*"No worries at all—those forms are so quick and easy to forget! But here's the thing: Whether you remember the specific ad or not, you clearly had a reason for wanting to learn more about other opportunities. So let me ask you this: Are you genuinely happy where you're at, or are there things you'd improve if you could?"*

*[This shifts focus from the ad to their current situation]*

---

**Based on Their Response:**

**If they say "Oh yeah, I remember now!" or "I am curious":**
- *"Awesome! Then I'm glad I called. Let me ask you a few quick questions so I can make sure we're a good fit before we schedule a longer conversation..."*
- Continue with discovery questions

**If they say "I'm not really looking" or "I don't think I filled that out":**
- *"I totally get it—and hey, if I pulled you away from something, I apologize! But since I have you for just 30 seconds, can I ask: On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your current brokerage?"*
- If they say 7 or below: *"Interesting—what would it take to get that to a 9 or 10?"*
- If they say 8+: *"That's great to hear! Out of curiosity, what makes it such a good fit for you?"* (This gives you intel on what they value)

**If they're genuinely confused or annoyed:**
- *"You know what, I apologize if I caught you at a bad time. Sometimes leads get mixed up. Tell you what—I'll let you go, and if you ever are curious about opportunities with us, you have my number now. Sound good?"*
- Exit gracefully, update status in Brokerkit to "Not Interested"

---

**Key Principles for This Objection:**
- NEVER make them feel bad or defensive
- Acknowledge it's easy to forget online forms
- Shift focus from "the ad" to "their current situation"
- Give them an easy, no-pressure path forward
- Be willing to let them go if they're truly not interested

---

### **Script 3: Voicemail Script**

When they don't answer:

---

*"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Brokerage]. I saw you inquired about opportunities with our team through [Facebook/Instagram], and I wanted to personally reach out. I know you're busy, so I'm also going to shoot you a quick text with some info. If you're open to a conversation about what we offer, I'd love to connect. My number is [your number], or just text me back. Thanks!"*

**Follow Up Immediately:**
- Text within 2 minutes
- Email within 5 minutes

---

### **Script 4: Text Message Templates**

**Text #1 (Right After Voicemail):**

*"Hi [First Name]! [Your Name] from [Brokerage] here. Just tried calling about your inquiry with us. Here's a quick link to schedule a call when you're free: [calendar link]. No pressure—just want to answer any questions you might have!"*

---

**Text #2 (Follow-Up After 3 Days - No Response):**

*"Hey [First Name], just wanted to follow up! Still curious about what we offer, or did I catch you at a busy time? If you're interested, grab a time here: [calendar link]. If not, totally understand—just let me know!"*

---

**Text #3 (Follow-Up After 7 Days - Permission to Stop):**

*"Hi [First Name], I know how busy life gets! This is my last check-in about opportunities with [Brokerage]. If you're interested in chatting, here's my calendar: [calendar link]. If not, no worries at all—I'll stop bugging you! 😊"*

*(This "permission to stop" message often gets responses)*

---

**Text #4 (If They Engage But Don't Book):**

*"Thanks for getting back to me! I know calendars are crazy. Here's the link again when you have a minute: [calendar link]. I promise it'll be a helpful conversation even if you don't end up making a move!"*

---

### **Script 5: Email Templates**

**Email #1 (Initial Outreach):**

**Subject:** Following up: [Your Brokerage Name]

Hi [First Name],

I saw you recently inquired about real estate opportunities with [Brokerage Name] through our [Facebook/Instagram] ad—thanks for your interest!

I'd love to schedule a brief, no-pressure call to:
- Learn about your current situation and goals
- Share what makes our brokerage different
- See if there might be a mutual fit

**[Book a time here: CALENDAR LINK]**

Even if you're just exploring options, I think you'll find the conversation valuable.

Looking forward to connecting!

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Brokerage]
[Your Phone]

---

**Email #2 (Follow-Up After 3 Days):**

**Subject:** Still curious? Quick question for you

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my earlier message. I know inboxes get crowded!

Quick question: On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your current brokerage?

If it's anything less than a 9, we should talk. I've helped dozens of agents find better fits, and I might be able to help you too—even if it's not with us.

**[Schedule a call: CALENDAR LINK]**

No pressure—just a conversation.

[Your Name]

---

**Email #3 (Follow-Up After 7 Days - Value-Add):**

**Subject:** Free resource: [Topic relevant to your value prop]

Hi [First Name],

I realize you're probably busy, so I'll stop trying to schedule a call 🙂

But I wanted to share something that might be helpful regardless: [link to a valuable resource—guide, webinar, tool, etc. related to your value prop].

If your situation changes and you ever want to explore opportunities with [Brokerage Name], you know where to find me.

Best,
[Your Name]

*(This positions you as a resource, not just a recruiter)*

---

## **Part 4: Objection Handling**

### **Objection: "I Don't Remember That Ad"**

*(See detailed script above in Script 2)*

**Quick Tips:**
- Acknowledge it's normal to forget
- Reference the ad hook (leads, support, commission, etc.)
- Shift to their current situation
- Don't belabor the point about the ad

---

### **Objection: "I Was Just Curious—I'm Not Really Looking"**

**Your Response:**

*"I totally get that, and honestly, most of our best agents weren't actively looking when they first reached out. They were just curious, like you. But here's what I've found: Even if you're happy where you are, it's smart to know what else is out there. That way, if your situation ever changes, you're not starting from scratch."*

*"Can I ask—what would it take for you to actually consider making a move? Like, what would need to be different or better?"*

*[Listen—they're revealing their decision criteria]*

*"That makes sense. Well, even if you're just in exploration mode, I'd love to have a conversation so you know what we offer. Worst case, you walk away with some good intel about the market. Best case, you realize there's something here you didn't know you were missing. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call?"*

---

### **Objection: "I'm Happy Where I'm At"**

**Your Response:**

*"That's awesome! I'm genuinely glad to hear that. Out of curiosity, what makes it such a good fit for you?"*

*[Listen—this tells you what they value]*

*"That's great that they provide [whatever they mentioned]. Can I ask just one more question—purely out of curiosity: If there was one thing you could improve or add, what would it be?"*

*[Even "happy" agents usually have something they'd change]*

*"Interesting. You know, [acknowledge their point] is actually something we really focus on. I'm not trying to pull you away from something that's working, but would you be open to a quick conversation just to see what we offer? Think of it as market intelligence—even if you don't make a move, it's good to know what's out there."*

---

### **Objection: "I'm Under Contract"**

**Your Response:**

*"Totally understand—contracts matter. Can I ask when your contract is up?"*

*[Note the date]*

*"Got it. Well, I don't want to create any issues for you, so I'll respect that timeline. How about this: Can I reach back out around [month before their contract ends] to reconnect? By that time, you'll have a better sense of whether you want to stay or explore options."*

*[Set a follow-up task in Brokerkit for 30 days before their contract ends]*

*"Perfect. I'll make a note and we'll reconnect then. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have questions, you have my number. Sound good?"*

---

### **Objection: "What's Your Commission Split?"**

**Your Response:**

*"I appreciate you getting right to it! Our splits are competitive and honestly depend on what level of support you want. But here's what I've learned: The agents who focus only on splits often leave money on the table."*

*"Can I ask—what are you currently netting after all your fees, desk costs, and expenses?"*

*[This shifts from gross split to net income]*

*"And how many deals are you doing per year?"*

*[Calculate their current net per deal]*

*"Okay, so here's why I asked: Our model is [explain your value prop—leads provided, lower fees, better support, etc.], which means even though our split might look similar on paper, agents often net more per deal AND close more deals. Does that make sense?"*

*"I'd love to walk you through the full financial picture on a call so you can see the math. Would you be open to that?"*

---

### **Objection: "I Need to Think About It"**

**Your Response:**

*"Absolutely—this is a big decision and you should take your time. Can I ask what specifically you want to think about? Maybe I can clarify anything that's unclear."*

*[Address their specific concerns]*

*"I totally understand. Here's what might be helpful: Why don't we schedule a follow-up call for [3-5 days from now]? That gives you some time to think, and then we can reconnect and you can ask me any questions that come up in the meantime. Does [specific day/time] work?"*

**Alternative Approach:**

*"That's fair. Out of curiosity, what would a 'yes' look like for you? Like, what would need to happen for you to feel confident about making a move?"*

*[This uncovers their true decision criteria and timeline]*

---

### **Objection: "I'm Interviewing with Other Brokerages"**

**Your Response:**

*"Smart! You should absolutely talk to multiple companies. Can I ask who you're talking with?"*

*[Listen—this tells you about their priorities]*

*"They're a solid company for sure. Here's what I'd say: Even if you're leaning toward them, it's worth having a conversation with us too so you can make an informed decision. You might find we offer things they don't—or vice versa."*

*"Think of it like this: You wouldn't buy a house after seeing just one property, right? Same principle here. Would you be open to a quick 20-minute call so you have all the info before you decide?"*

---

### **Objection: "Send Me Some Information First"**

**Your Response:**

*"I totally get that—you want to see what we're about before investing time in a call. Here's my challenge with just sending info: Real estate brokerages are all about people and culture, and that's really hard to capture in an email or a brochure."*

*"What I'd rather do is jump on a quick 15-minute call where I can answer your specific questions and you can get a feel for who we are. If after that call you want more info, I'll happily send it. Does that work?"*

**Alternative Response (If They Push Back):**

*"I hear you. Tell you what—I'll send you a link to our website and some info, but I'll also include my calendar link. After you review everything, if you have questions or want to dive deeper, grab a time and we'll talk. Fair enough?"*

*(Then actually send materials AND calendar link via email)*

---

### **Objection: "This Feels Like a Sales Pitch"**

**Your Response:**

*"You know what—that's totally fair feedback, and I appreciate you being direct. Here's the truth: I AM excited about what we're building here, and I do think we offer something special. So yeah, I'm definitely sharing why I think this could be a great fit."*

*"But here's what I'm NOT trying to do: Talk you into something that's not right for you. That doesn't help either of us."*

*"So let me flip this around—what questions do YOU have for ME? What do you actually want to know?"*

*[Let them drive the conversation—this builds trust]*

---

## **Part 5: Multi-Touch Follow-Up Strategy**

Social ad leads require persistence—most won't respond to the first attempt. Here's your systematic approach:

### **The Complete Follow-Up Sequence**

**Day 1 (Same Day or Next Day):**
- Call attempt #1 (use Script 1)
- If no answer: Leave voicemail
- Send Text #1 immediately after voicemail
- Send Email #1 within 5-10 minutes

**Day 2:**
- Call attempt #2 at a different time of day
- If no answer: Don't leave another voicemail
- Log the attempt in Brokerkit

**Day 3:**
- Send Text #2 (follow-up text)
- Call attempt #3 if they responded to text

**Day 5:**
- Send Email #2 (follow-up email with question hook)
- Call attempt #4 if email is opened

**Day 7:**
- Send Text #3 ("permission to stop" text)
- Call attempt #5 if they respond

**Day 10:**
- Send Email #3 (value-add email with resource)
- Final call attempt if they engage with email

**Day 14:**
- Make final call attempt
- Leave final voicemail: *"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. I've reached out a few times about your inquiry. I don't want to be a pest, so this is my last call. If you're still interested, I'd love to connect—my number is [number]. If not, no worries at all. Best of luck!"*

**Day 30+:**
- If still no response, update status to "Nurture - Long Term"
- Set a 90-day follow-up task with note: "Re-engage via email to check if timing has changed"
- Add to occasional newsletter/updates list (stay top of mind passively)

---

### **Multi-Channel Best Practices**

**Do:**
- ✅ Vary your times of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- ✅ Reference previous attempts ("I've tried reaching you...")
- ✅ Make it incredibly easy to respond (calendar links, one-click options)
- ✅ Be friendly and conversational, never pushy or desperate
- ✅ Log EVERY touchpoint in Brokerkit

**Don't:**
- ❌ Leave multiple voicemails (one is enough)
- ❌ Send the exact same message across channels
- ❌ Guilt-trip or pressure them
- ❌ Give up after 2-3 attempts (the magic happens at touch 4-7)
- ❌ Forget to track your activity—you'll lose track fast

---

### **Tracking Everything in Brokerkit**

Stay organized by documenting all activity:

**After Every Call:**
1. Open the lead's profile in Brokerkit
2. Add a detailed note:
   - Date/time of call
   - Reached them or voicemail?
   - Key conversation points if connected
   - Their level of interest (1-10 scale)
   - Objections or concerns raised
   - Next steps agreed upon
3. Update their status appropriately

**After Every Text/Email:**
- Log it with a note about content and any response
- Track engagement (opened, clicked, replied)
- Set follow-up reminders

**Setting Strategic Follow-Up Tasks:**
- "Contact in 90 days" for timing-based objections
- "Follow up day before meeting" for scheduled calls
- "Check in after contract expires" for under-contract agents
- "Re-engage in 6 months" for happy-but-curious leads

**Using Status Updates Effectively:**
- **Lead:** Just came in
- **Contact Attempted:** You've tried but haven't connected
- **Contact Made:** You've had at least one conversation
- **Interested - Exploring:** They're curious but not ready to move
- **Appt Set:** Discovery call scheduled
- **Needs Evaluated:** After first meeting, determining fit
- **Offer Extended:** You've made them an offer
- **Signed:** They've joined your team!
- **Not Interested:** They declined or not a fit
- **Nurture - Long Term:** Warm lead for future follow-up (timing not right now)

---

## **Part 6: Converting Explorers to Recruits**

Remember: Social ad leads are often explorers, not active job seekers. Your approach must be consultative, not transactional.

### **The Discovery Call Framework**

**Purpose:**
- Understand their current situation deeply
- Uncover frustrations, desires, and motivations
- Share your value proposition in context of their needs
- Determine mutual fit
- Move to next step (offer, trial period, shadow day, etc.)

**Suggested Structure (20-30 minutes):**

**Opening (2 min):**
*"Thanks so much for making the time! I know how crazy schedules get in this business. Here's what I'd like to do: I want to learn about you, your business, and your goals, and then I'll share what we offer and we can see if there's a potential fit. Sound good? And feel free to ask me anything along the way."*

**Their Story (10 min):**
- *"Tell me about your real estate journey—how'd you get into this business?"*
- *"How many deals are you doing per year? What's your average price point?"*
- *"Walk me through your typical business model—are you getting leads, working a sphere, farming a neighborhood?"*
- *"What do you love most about where you're at currently?"*
- *"If you could wave a magic wand, what's the ONE thing you'd improve?"*

**Your Offering (10 min):**

Based on what they shared, present your value proposition:

*"So based on what you're telling me about [their pain point], here's how we approach that..."*

Cover:
- Your unique value proposition (what makes you different)
- Commission structure and financial model
- Lead generation or support systems
- Training and mentorship available
- Technology and tools
- Company culture and agent success stories

**Address Concerns (5 min):**

*"What questions do you have? What concerns are coming up for you?"*

[Address openly and honestly]

**Next Steps (3 min):**

**If They're Clearly Interested:**
*"Well [Name], I think you'd be a great fit for our team, and it sounds like we have what you're looking for. Here's what I'd like to propose as next steps: [your process—offer letter, trial period, shadow day, meet the team, etc.]. How does that sound?"*

**If You Need to Evaluate:**
*"Thanks so much for your time today. I really enjoyed learning about your business. Let me [talk to my team / review your production / prepare an offer], and I'll get back to you by [specific date] with next steps. Sound good?"*

**If They Need to Think:**
*"I completely understand—this is a big decision. What questions are still on your mind?"*

[Address questions]

*"Take a couple days to think it over. How about we reconnect on [specific date]? I'll send you a calendar invite for that, and in the meantime, if anything comes up, you have my number."*

---

### **Moving from Discovery to Hire**

**Typical Next Steps:**

1. **Shadow Day / Office Visit:**
   - Let them see your operation firsthand
   - Meet the team and other agents
   - Experience your culture
   - Addresses any final concerns

2. **Trial Period / Soft Commitment:**
   - Some brokerages offer a "try before you buy" approach
   - Allows mutual evaluation with lower commitment
   - Reduces risk for both parties

3. **Formal Offer:**
   - Written offer with commission structure, support details, and terms
   - Time-bound (creates urgency)
   - Clear next steps and timeline

4. **Onboarding:**
   - License transfer process
   - Setup in your systems
   - Initial training and orientation
   - Mentorship pairing

## **Final Thoughts: Your Recipe for Social Ad Success**

Social ad leads are explorers, not job seekers. They require a different approach—more consultative, less transactional. Here's your recipe:

1. **Speed Matters, But So Does Subtlety** – Contact them within 24-48 hours, but don't be pushy
2. **Master the "I Don't Remember" Response** – This will be your most common objection; handle it smoothly
3. **Be Consultative, Not Salesy** – Position yourself as a helpful resource, not just a recruiter
4. **Ask Great Questions** – Uncover their true motivations and frustrations
5. **Multi-Touch Persistence** – Most conversions happen on touch 4-7, not 1-2
6. **Track Everything** – Brokerkit is your command center; use it religiously
7. **Play the Long Game** – Not everyone is ready now, but staying top of mind wins over time

Remember: You're not filling a seat—you're finding the right people who will thrive on your team. Take the time to understand each person, and focus on mutual fit over volume.

Social media has given you access to agents you'd never reach through traditional recruiting. Make the most of it by being professional, persistent, and helpful.

Now go turn those inquiries into great hires!
