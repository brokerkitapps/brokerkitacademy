## **Part 2: Understanding Lead Quality and Prioritization**

### **AI Resume Scoring**

Every candidate's resume is automatically reviewed by our AI scoring agent:

**Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale):**
- Real estate experience and licensing status
- Relevant skills and qualifications
- Career trajectory and stability
- Educational background
- Location alignment with your market

**Qualification Thresholds:**
- **Qualified:** Score meets or exceeds your defined threshold (appears in recruiting pipeline)
- **Unqualified:** Score below threshold (can be auto-archived based on your archive threshold setting)

**Where to Find Scoring Details:**
- Open any candidate's profile in Brokerkit
- Review the "Referrer Notes" section
- See the AI-generated score, reasoning, and suggested follow-up approaches

### **Prioritizing Your Outreach**

Not all qualified leads are equal. Prioritize based on:

1. **Recency:** Contact new leads within 24 hours (same-day is ideal)
2. **Score:** Higher-scored candidates first (8-10 before 6-7)
3. **Experience Level:** Match priority to your hiring goals
   - Seeking new agents? Prioritize career changers
   - Seeking producers? Prioritize licensed agents with track records
4. **Resume Quality:** Well-formatted resumes often indicate serious candidates
5. **Engagement Signals:** Candidates who opened your automated emails show higher intent

### **Best Times to Contact Job Seekers**

Job seekers have different availability patterns than employed agents:

**Best Times:**
- **Weekday mornings:** 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (catching them before afternoon plans)
- **Weekday late afternoons:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Weekday evenings:** 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM (after dinner, before evening plans)

**Avoid:**
- Early mornings before 9 AM
- Lunch hours (12-1 PM)
- Late evenings after 8 PM
- Weekends (job seekers compartmentalize job hunting to weekdays)

### **Pre-Call Preparation (2-3 Minutes)**

Before calling any candidate, review:

✅ Their resume (click "Resume" tab in their Brokerkit profile)
✅ AI score and qualification reasoning (Referrer Notes section)
✅ Suggested follow-up approaches from the AI
✅ Their application date (how long have they been waiting?)
✅ Any automated emails they've opened or clicked

**Set yourself up for success:**
- Have their Brokerkit profile open on your screen
- Keep a notepad ready for call notes
- Have your calendar link ready to share
- Be in a quiet environment
- Smile before you dial (they can hear it!)

## **Part 3: Initial Contact Call Scripts**

### **Script 1: First Contact Call (Job Ad Inquiry)**

Use this script when calling a candidate who inquired through your job posting:

---

**Introduction:**

*"Hi [Candidate's Name], this is [Your Name] with [Your Brokerage]. How are you doing today?"*

*[Wait for response]*

*"Great! Hey, I wanted to reach out because I saw you inquired about the real estate agent opportunity with us. I know you're probably busy, so I'll be quick—do you have just a couple of minutes?"*

*[If they say "I don't remember applying" – see Objection Handling below]*

---

**If They Say Yes:**

*"Awesome! First, thanks for your interest in joining our team. I had a chance to review your resume and I'm impressed with [specific positive thing from their resume—this shows you actually looked]."*

*"Can I ask—what sparked your interest in exploring real estate as a career?"*

*[Listen carefully—this reveals their motivation]*

---

**Discovery Questions (Choose 2-3):**

*"What attracted you to our company specifically?"*

*"Are you currently working in another field, or are you already licensed?"*

*"What's your timeline? Are you looking to get started right away, or planning for a few months from now?"*

*"Have you had a chance to talk with any other brokerages, or are we your first conversation?"*

*"What's most important to you in choosing where to launch your real estate career?"*

*[Listen for: training needs, income goals, flexibility desires, support expectations]*

---

**The Transition:**

*"That's really helpful context. Based on what you're sharing, I think there could be a great fit here. We specialize in [your unique value prop], which sounds like exactly what you're looking for."*

*"Here's what I'd love to do: Let's schedule a brief 20-minute call where I can walk you through our training program, commission structure, and support system, and you can ask me any questions. No pressure at all—just a conversation to see if we're a mutual fit. Does that sound good?"*

---

**Closing:**

- **If YES:** *"Perfect! Let me send you a link to my calendar so you can grab a time that works for you. What's the best way to send that—text or email?"*
  - Send the link immediately
  - *"Great, I just sent it over. Go ahead and book a time, and I'll send you a confirmation. Looking forward to talking more!"*

- **If NOT NOW:** *"I totally understand—timing isn't always right. Can I stay in touch? Maybe I can check back in a month or two when things settle down?"*
  - Log a 60-day follow-up task in Brokerkit
  - *"Sounds good! I'll make a note and circle back with you in [timeframe]. In the meantime, if anything changes and you want to chat sooner, feel free to reach out. You have my number now!"*

- **If NOT INTERESTED:** *"I completely understand, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. If anything changes down the road or you know anyone who might be a fit, please don't hesitate to reach out. Best of luck in your job search!"*
  - Update their status to "Not Interested" in Brokerkit

---

### **Script 2: Handling "I Don't Remember Applying"**

This is common! People fill out quick forms and forget. Handle it smoothly:

---

**The Smooth Response:**

*"Oh no worries at all! You filled out a quick form on [Indeed/ZipRecruiter/job board] expressing interest in learning about real estate opportunities with us. It was probably just a 30-second thing—easy to forget with everything going on!"*

*[Pause briefly, stay light and friendly]*

*"But hey, since I have you on the phone, I'd love to ask you a quick question: Is real estate still something you're exploring, or did I catch you at a time when you're focused on other opportunities?"*

**Their Response Determines Next Steps:**

**If they say "Yes, still exploring":**
- *"Awesome! Then I'm glad I called. Let me tell you a bit about what we offer..."*
- Continue with discovery questions from Script 1

**If they say "Not really" or "I'm not sure":**
- *"I totally get it—priorities change. Can I ask what you're focused on now in your career search?"*
- Listen and either:
  - Pivot if real estate could still fit: *"Interesting! You know, a lot of our best agents came from [their field]. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if there's a connection?"*
  - Or gracefully exit: *"That makes total sense. Well hey, if real estate ever comes back on your radar, you have my number. Best of luck with [their goal]!"*

**Key Principles:**
- Never make them feel bad for not remembering
- Stay light, upbeat, and conversational
- Give them an easy "out" if they're not interested
- Focus on where they are NOW, not on the application they don't remember

---

### **Script 3: Voicemail Script**

If they don't answer (which is common):

---

*"Hi [Candidate's Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Brokerage]. I saw you inquired about our real estate agent opportunity and I wanted to reach out personally to answer any questions. I know you're probably busy, so I'll also send you a quick text and email with some info. If you're still exploring real estate as a career, I'd love to connect. You can call me back at [your number] or just text me. Thanks and talk soon!"*

**Follow Up Immediately:**
- Send a text message within 2 minutes
- Send an email within 5 minutes
- Both should include your calendar link

---

### **Script 4: Text Message Templates**

**Text #1 (Right After Voicemail):**

*"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. I just called about your inquiry with us. Here's a quick link to schedule a call when you're free: [calendar link]. No pressure—just want to answer any questions! 🙂"*

**Text #2 (Follow-Up After 3 Days, No Response):**

*"Hi [First Name]! Just wanted to follow up on the real estate opportunity. Still interested in learning more? If so, grab a time here: [calendar link]. If not, no worries—just let me know!"*

**Text #3 (Final Follow-Up After 7 Days):**

*"Hi [First Name], I know things get busy! This is my last check-in about the agent opportunity with [Brokerage]. If you're still interested, I'd love to chat: [calendar link]. If not, I totally understand. Either way, best of luck! 🙂"*

---

### **Script 5: Email Templates**

**Email #1 (Initial Outreach):**

**Subject:** Following up on your inquiry - [Your Brokerage Name]

Hi [First Name],

I saw you recently inquired about real estate opportunities with [Brokerage Name]—thanks for your interest!

I'd love to schedule a brief call to:
- Share what makes our brokerage different
- Learn about your goals and timeline
- Answer any questions you have

No pressure at all—just a conversation to see if we're a mutual fit.

**[Book a time here: CALENDAR LINK]**

Looking forward to connecting!

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Brokerage]
[Your Phone]

---

**Email #2 (Follow-Up After 3 Days):**

**Subject:** Still interested? - [Your Brokerage Name]

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my earlier message. I know inboxes get crowded!

If you're still exploring real estate as a career, I'd genuinely love to chat. We've helped dozens of people make successful career transitions, and I'm happy to share how we support new agents.

**[Schedule a quick call: CALENDAR LINK]**

If now's not the right time, just let me know and I'll stop bugging you 🙂

Best,
[Your Name]

## **Part 4: Objection Handling**

### **Objection: "I Don't Remember Applying/Inquiring"**

**Why This Happens:**
- They filled out a quick form on a job board
- They applied to multiple positions
- It's been a few days and they forgot
- They were casually browsing

**Your Response:**

*"That's totally okay! You filled out a quick interest form on [job board name]—those things are easy to forget. But hey, I'm glad I caught you because I think you'd be a great fit based on your background. Can I ask—are you still exploring real estate as a career, or has your focus shifted?"*

**Key Principles:**
- Make it a non-issue
- Confirm their current interest level
- Move forward if they're still interested
- Give them an easy exit if they're not

---

### **Objection: "I'm Just Looking Around"**

**Your Response:**

*"I totally get that—smart to explore your options! Most of our best agents talked to 3-4 brokerages before deciding where to land. Can I ask what's most important to you as you evaluate different companies?"*

*[Listen to their criteria]*

*"That makes sense. Well, even if you're just in the exploring phase, I'd love to share what we offer so you have all the information when you do make your decision. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call so you can add us to your list of options to consider?"*

---

### **Objection: "What's Your Commission Split?"**

**Your Response:**

*"Great question—I appreciate you being direct! Our splits are competitive and depend on your experience level and the support you need. But honestly, I've found that the best agents care less about splits and more about total income potential."*

*"Can I ask—what are you hoping to earn in your first year? And are you more interested in having leads provided, or building your own book of business?"*

*[This shifts the conversation from splits to their goals]*

*"Perfect. Based on that, here's how our model works... [explain your value prop]. I'd love to walk you through the full compensation structure on a quick call so you can see the whole picture. Does [day/time] work for you?"*

---

### **Objection: "I Don't Have Any Real Estate Experience"**

**Your Response:**

*"That's actually not a problem at all—some of our top producers came from completely different industries. What matters more is your willingness to learn, your work ethic, and your people skills."*

*"Can I ask what you're doing now?"*

*[Listen to their background]*

*"You know what—your experience in [their field] is actually really valuable in real estate because [connect the dots]. Plus, we have a comprehensive training program designed specifically for people who are new to the industry. We don't expect you to know real estate—we'll teach you that. What we're looking for is the right attitude and commitment."*

*"Would you be open to a call where I can walk you through our training program and what the path looks like for someone starting from scratch?"*

---

### **Objection: "I Need to Think About It"**

**Your Response:**

*"Absolutely—this is a big decision and you should take your time! Can I ask what specifically you want to think about? Maybe I can help clarify anything that's unclear."*

*[If they share specific concerns, address them]*

*"I totally understand. Here's what I'd suggest: Why don't we schedule a follow-up call for [3-5 days from now]? That gives you some time to think, and then we can reconnect and you can ask me any questions that come up. Does [day/time] work?"*

**Alternative Close:**

*"That makes sense. Out of curiosity, if you were to move forward, what would need to happen? Like, what would make this a 'yes' for you?"*

*[This uncovers their decision criteria and any hidden objections]*

---

### **Objection: "I'm Already Interviewing with Another Brokerage"**

**Your Response:**

*"That's great! Smart to talk to multiple companies. Can I ask who you're talking with?"*

*[Listen—this tells you about their priorities]*

*"They're a solid company. Here's what I'd suggest: Even if you're leaning toward them, it's worth having a conversation with us too so you can make an informed comparison. You might find that we offer things they don't, or vice versa. Would you be open to a quick 20-minute call so you have all the information before you decide?"*

*"Think of it like buying a car—you wouldn't buy the first one you test drove, right? Same thing here!"*

---

### **Objection: "This Sounds Like a Sales Pitch"**

**Your Response:**

*"I hear you! And you're right—I'm definitely sharing why I think this could be a great fit. But here's the thing: I'm not trying to talk you into something that's not right for you. Bad hires hurt us just as much as they hurt you."*

*"What I AM trying to do is give you enough information so you can make a smart decision. So let me flip this around—what questions do YOU have for ME? What do you want to know?"*

*[Let them drive the conversation]*

---

## **Part 5: Multi-Channel Follow-Up Strategy**

Speed to lead matters, but so does persistence. Use all three channels strategically.

### **The Complete Follow-Up Sequence**

**Day 1 (Same Day as Application):**
- Call attempt #1 (use Script 1)
- If no answer: Leave voicemail
- Send Text #1 immediately after voicemail
- Send Email #1 within 5 minutes

**Day 2:**
- Call attempt #2 at a different time of day
- If no answer: Don't leave another voicemail (they have your first one)
- Note the attempt in Brokerkit

**Day 3:**
- Send Text #2 (follow-up text)
- Call attempt #3 if they responded to text but haven't booked

**Day 5:**
- Send Email #2 (follow-up email)
- Call attempt #4 if email is opened

**Day 7:**
- Send Text #3 (final follow-up)
- Call attempt #5 if they respond

**Day 10:**
- Make final call attempt
- Leave final voicemail if needed: *"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Brokerage]. I've tried reaching you a few times about the real estate opportunity. I don't want to be a pest, so this'll be my last call. If you're still interested, I'd love to connect—just give me a call back or text. If not, no worries at all. Best of luck in your career search!"*

**Day 30+:**
- If still no response, update status to "Cold Lead"
- Set a 90-day follow-up task with note: "Re-engage via email to see if timing has changed"

---

### **Multi-Channel Coordination Tips**

**Do:**
- ✅ Call first (phone is highest-value contact)
- ✅ Follow phone with text/email same day
- ✅ Reference previous attempts ("I've tried reaching you...")
- ✅ Make it easy to respond (calendar links, direct phone number)
- ✅ Track every attempt in Brokerkit

**Don't:**
- ❌ Leave multiple voicemails (one is enough)
- ❌ Send identical messages across channels
- ❌ Be pushy or guilt-trippy in your messaging
- ❌ Give up after 2 attempts (most conversions happen on attempt 3-5)
- ❌ Forget to log your activity

---

### **Tracking Everything in Brokerkit**

Stay organized by logging every touchpoint:

**After Every Call:**
1. Open the candidate's profile
2. Add a note under "Activity" with:
   - Date/time of call
   - Whether you reached them or left voicemail
   - Key points from conversation (if you spoke)
   - Next steps
3. Update their status if appropriate (After Lead, Contact Attempted, Contact Made, etc.)

**After Every Text/Email:**
- Log it in a note
- Track if they responded
- Set follow-up tasks

**Setting Follow-Up Tasks:**
- If they ask to be contacted later, set a task for that specific date
- If they're not ready now, set a 60-90 day follow-up
- If they book a meeting, set a reminder for 24 hours before to confirm

**Using Status Updates:**
- **Lead:** Just came in
- **After Lead:** You've reviewed and are ready to contact
- **Contact Attempted:** You've tried reaching them but haven't connected
- **Contact Made:** You've had a conversation
- **Appt Set:** They've booked an interview/meeting
- **Needs Evaluated:** After first meeting
- **Offer Sent:** You've extended an offer
- **Signed:** They've accepted and joined!
- **Not Interested:** They declined
- **Cold Lead:** No response after full sequence

---

## **Part 6: Converting Leads to Interviews**

Your goal isn't to recruit them on the first call—it's to get them to the next step.

### **The Interview/Discovery Call**

**What It Is:**
- A 20-30 minute conversation (phone or in-person)
- Deeper dive into their goals and your offering
- Chance for them to ask detailed questions
- Opportunity for you to assess fit

**How to Position It:**

*"Here's what I'd love to do: Let's schedule a brief call where I can walk you through our training program, compensation structure, and support systems, and you can ask me anything you want. Think of it as a two-way interview—you're interviewing us just as much as we're interviewing you. No pressure at all. Sound good?"*

### **What to Cover in the Interview:**

**Your Agenda:**
1. **Their Story** (10 min)
   - Why real estate?
   - Career goals and timeline
   - Experience level
   - Concerns or questions

2. **Your Offering** (15 min)
   - Training program overview
   - Commission structure and earning potential
   - Lead generation and support
   - Technology and tools
   - Company culture

3. **Next Steps** (5 min)
   - What the onboarding process looks like
   - Timeline to get started
   - What they need to do (get licensed, background check, etc.)
   - When they can expect to hear from you

### **Closing the Interview**

**If They're Clearly a Fit:**

*"Well [Name], based on our conversation, I think you'd be a great addition to our team. Here's what I'd like to do next: [explain your process—background check, offer letter, orientation, etc.]. Does that sound good to you?"*

**If You Need to Think About It:**

*"Thanks so much for your time today. I really enjoyed learning about your background. Let me review everything with my team, and I'll get back to you by [specific date] with next steps. In the meantime, if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out!"*

**If They Need to Think About It:**

*"I totally understand—this is a big decision. What questions are still on your mind that I can help answer?"*

*[Address their questions]*

*"Perfect. How about this: Take a couple days to think it over, and let's reconnect on [specific date]. I'll send you a calendar link for that. And if anything comes up before then, you have my number. Sound good?"*

## **Final Thoughts: Your Recipe for Job Ad Success**

Job ad leads are some of the warmest recruiting leads you'll get—they came to you! Here's your recipe for converting them:

1. **Speed Matters** – Contact them within 24 hours (ideally same-day)
2. **Be Human** – These are real people making big career decisions, not just resumes
3. **Smooth Objection Handling** – When they don't remember applying, make it a non-issue and keep moving forward
4. **Multi-Channel Persistence** – Phone + text + email = maximum reach
5. **Track Everything** – Log every interaction in Brokerkit
6. **Focus on Fit** – Your goal is mutual fit, not convincing someone who's not right
7. **Follow Through** – Do what you say you'll do, when you say you'll do it

Remember: You're not filling a quota—you're building a team. Take the time to find people who are genuinely excited about joining you, and give them the information and support they need to make that decision.

Now go turn those inquiries into hires!
